         <snippet>After seeing Everybody's Fine, Paul McCartney offered to write a song that plays over the closing credits. That may be because the whole movie is like a celluloid McCartney tune: warm and playful and sweetly earnest, but lightly funny, too, and crafted with consummate skill.</snippet>

         <snippet>Here, the actor (Di Niro) dials it down and wins us over.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie works because so much of what's on screen will resonate with viewers.</snippet>

         <snippet>At one point, Frank contemplates a wheeled suitcase and infuses in that one moment the sweetness and vulnerability of E.T. See Everybody's Fine, but one piece of advice: Phone home first.</snippet>

         <snippet>"Relief" is the word for it. It's a relief to see Robert De Niro giving an honest, effective starring performance in a project that does not stink and that, in fact, rises to a respectable level of filmmaking proficiency. How long has it been?</snippet>

         <snippet>De Niro's minimalist performance has maximum emotional impact and succeeds in unifying the episodic film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Now comes this American version, which turns out to be the exception, an American remake that's better than the European original.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is sentimental but dramatically solid, its placid themes fortified by De Niro.</snippet>

         <snippet>All that could redeem this thoroughly foreseeable unfolding would be colorful characters and good acting. Everybody's Fine comes close, but not close enough.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though a bit too artful to merit the pejorative "tearjerker" label, the film is rigorously streamlined to deliver a good emotional uppercut by the end, and purely on the strength of its craft, it connects.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is the kind of work a great actor does when he's not preoccupied with giving a great performance. Its very casualness is its big selling point.</snippet>

         <snippet>If nothing else (and there ain't much else), Everybody's Fine does prove one thing: Even an actor with the gifts of Robert De Niro can't make bland interesting.</snippet>
