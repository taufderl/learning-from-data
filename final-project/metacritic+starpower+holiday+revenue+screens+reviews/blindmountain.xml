         <snippet>Twenty years ago, Li's film might have served as a warning; today, it rues a dehumanizing economic system run rampant that leaves one sad slave wife to muse, "It's easy to die. It's living that's hard."</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a resolutely tough-minded, beautifully crafted film so compelling as to make bearable watching the nearly unbearable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Liâ€™s story is lean and economical, but deeply harrowing, as Xuemei--sympathetically played by debuting performer Huang Lu, the only classically trained actor in a cast of non-professionals--clings to her courage and tries again and again to escape.</snippet>

         <snippet>A potent drama from Yang Li, one of China's Sixth Generation filmmakers noted for the stark realism and documentary feeling of their work.</snippet>

         <snippet>Blind Mountain is a reminder that art sometimes keeps the truth alive far better than the news.</snippet>

         <snippet>Blind Mountain would be better-served by more touches of universality, as in the scene where a neighbor woman comforts Huang by saying, "All women go through this." That scene flirts with metaphor. The rest of the film too often descends into harangue.</snippet>

         <snippet>Low on drama and originality, and high on deja vu, sophomore outing by writer-director Li Yang ("Blind Shaft," 2003).</snippet>

         <snippet>Blind Mountain forces its way through numerous illogicalities and several plot lapses to a violently abrupt ending.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie not only indicts the country's embrace of capitalism by showing how low people will sink to make money, it also denigrates the agrarian class--once celebrated as heroic under Mao--by portraying its members as illiterate barbarians concerned only with continuing their family lines.</snippet>
