         <snippet>The film manages to be anything but dark; whimsy and sweet irony are laced throughout, a warmhearted blend that turned it into the surprise winner of 2008's Oscar for foreign-language film.</snippet>

         <snippet>It will absolutely delight the art-house crowd. Multiplexes will be crowded with noisy summer films, after all, from which Departures will represent a sophisticated and elegant departure.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yojiro Takita, who directed enduring commercial hits like "The Ying Yang Master" and "The Yen Family," has made a popular gem -- thematically respectable, technically hard to fault, artfully scripted to entertain and touch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Departures is built for simplicity, and, if nothing else, the appeal to decency and integrity of this sweetly old-fashioned tale make it a must for Bernie Madoff's prison Netflix queue.</snippet>

         <snippet>The fascination, humor and poignancy of  Departures, this year's winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, rests in the Japanese ceremony of preparing bodies for their caskets.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yojiro Takita's movie simultaneously tickles tears of mourning as it wrings laughs about the meaning of life.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Yojiro Takita uses the changing seasons to echo the characters' moods; the score by Joe Hisaishi (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle) has a suitably majestic sweep.</snippet>

         <snippet>TV scribe Kundo Koyama's first bigscreen script peppers the proceedings with rich character detail and near-screwball interludes that shouldn't fit but somehow do.</snippet>

         <snippet>Departures is tender and, at times, rather squishy. It's sure to squeeze the tear ducts of anyone who has lost a parent.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is the kind of tastefully poignant drama that asks its audience to confront taboos and then pats them on the back for doing so.</snippet>

         <snippet>Departures is, well … a nice film. It breaks no new ground, offers no audacious insights or rude revelations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Takita could easily trim 30 minutes of flab and oceans of tears from Departures. It still wouldn't merit an Oscar, but it would be a lot more watchable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The acting is quite deft, if extremely broad, but screenwriter Kundo Koyama seesaws uncertainly between jokes and grief.</snippet>

         <snippet>It will resonate with anyone who has ever buried a loved one and struggled to reconcile the myriad emotions--grief, anger, helplessness. Which is to say, everyone. And yet out of this premise comes glop. Departures needed a little more work in the morgue--like cutting to the bone.</snippet>

         <snippet>Overlong, predictable in its plotting and utterly banal in its blending of comic whimsy and melodramatic pathos.</snippet>
