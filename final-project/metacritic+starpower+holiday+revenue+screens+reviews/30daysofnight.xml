         <snippet>Decent vampire movies are few and far between, and I’m having a hard time remembering a recent one that impressed me like 30 Days of Night.</snippet>

         <snippet>This slick and sticky horror is the most accomplished treatment of vampire lore since Near Dark.</snippet>

         <snippet>Works on its own terms, which is more than can be said of most horror films these days. If this is the kind of movie you're looking for, it delivers.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not perfect or "Shining"-level inspired, but it's solid.</snippet>

         <snippet>A well-paced and entertaining horror debut.</snippet>

         <snippet>It loses some of its bite by film's end, but 30 Days of Night manages to do for the vampire genre what "28 Days Later" did for the zombie flick: give age-old monsters a modern-day makeover.</snippet>

         <snippet>Directed by David Slade ("Hard Candy"), the action scenes are artful and terrifying; these killers move so quickly and decisively, there seems to be no hope for humanity.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>These days, it's dark everywhere. Which makes Slade's wild, often exhilarating neo-Western ride into frostbit vampirism something of a respite, albeit one awash gore.</snippet>

         <snippet>Which is more interesting: Vampires fighting over the potential long-term blowback of their Alaskan buffet, or a couple of exes bonding under duress? Seems like an easy decision, but 30 Days Of Night makes the wrong choice.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mark Boone Jr. makes a vivid impression as eccentric loner Beau Brower, and Danny Huston is mesmerizing as the leader of the shrieking, slashing, wallowing-in-gore bloodsuckers. They effortlessly eclipse the rest of the cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like most kiddies games, this one starts out fun and then gets tired. Inevitably, that's when Slade tries to revive our interest by upping the gore quotient.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is well-made, well-photographed and plausibly acted, and is better than it needs to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>Based on a graphic novel, 30 Days of Night opens with a premise so promising it seems almost impossible to screw up.</snippet>

         <snippet>Danny Huston is screamingly funny as the alternately finicky and savage Head Ghoul--he’s like something spewed forth from the bowels of the Politburo. The problem is structural.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's seductive in its buildup but overall as subtle and, alas, as humorless as a hatchet to the brain.</snippet>

         <snippet>With such a good concept for a vampire movie, it's hard to believe it turned out to be this boring.</snippet>

         <snippet>Excels at bloodthirsty action, though dialogue and human-interest aspects are a tad anemic. Result is a mixed bag but has a catchy premise and quite enough splatter to satisfy gorehounds.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nearly two hours long, 30 Days of Night makes you feel the cold (though it was shot in New Zealand) and feel the fangs, but it also makes you feel like 30 days is a pretty long time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Forget about a stake through the heart: sheriff Josh Hartnett discovers that decapitation is the best way to stop the bloodsuckers, who suggest feral, steroid-crazed gymnasts as they scale buildings and leap onto moving vehicles.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie approaches the final scene with a straight face, but it left the audience giggling spasmodically. This script probably should have gone all the way and thrown in a few quips: If your movie is a joke, at least be intentionally funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>You can expect a lot of shredding and gurgling. 30 Days of Night is relentless, but it's also relentlessly one-note.</snippet>
