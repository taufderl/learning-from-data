         <snippet>It's the most intense, unpredictable and thrilling cinematic experience I've had the pleasure to squirm through in ages.</snippet>

         <snippet>The director of The Descent is savvy enough to suggest even more than he shows. And he's old-school enough to load up on glimpses of good, clean, gruesome gore.</snippet>

         <snippet>Neil Marshall's horrifically terrific The Descent cannily recasts 1972's "Deliverance" as a female-bonding thriller with some "Hills Have Eyes"-style mutant terror tossed in for truly harrowing effect.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the film's downbeat ending was softened for U.S. release, it's still a long way from happy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brutal, bloody, terrifying, astonishing... And so tense it'll leave you aching. The most significant Brit chiller since "28 Days Later."</snippet>

         <snippet>This one is a creepy white-knuckle excursion into horror, where even the "boo!" moments are so well developed that they cause a jolt.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is one of the scariest movies featuring female heroines since the "Alien" series, and what makes it uniquely scary is where these women are -- in tunnels two miles under ground -- when they realize they are not alone.</snippet>

         <snippet>At the heart of the film, beyond the human/crawler conflict, is the suppressed tension between Sarah and Juno. That Marshall bothered to include such a fillip sets him apart from run-of-the-mill scaremongers; it makes me want to see what else he's done and will do.</snippet>

         <snippet>Marshall takes a modest budget and a concept that isn't all that original and produces a frightening, intelligent and sexy thriller.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the women's battle with the cave creatures has fine jump-from-your-seat moments, it gradually becomes the same chase flick horror fans have seen dozens of times. OK, it's a darn good one in most respects.</snippet>

         <snippet>What follows is a sensationally entertaining escalation of frights, the kind that make you wiggle and squirm as you alternately laugh at your own gullibility and marvel at the filmmaker's cunning and craft.</snippet>

         <snippet>You either go for a movie like this or you don't. But though I didn't like it much, I've got to admit that The Descent is a nerve-jangler.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eventually, though, the monsters come out -- blind, snarling cave-dwellers, looking much like Gollum's bigger kin -- and The Descent becomes a simple exercise in guessing who, if anyone, will survive.</snippet>

         <snippet>This intermittently effective UK horror thriller carefully establishes the psychological relationships among the women, then squanders this calibrated and generally plausible setup with a series of crude, implausible, and scattershot horror effects.</snippet>
