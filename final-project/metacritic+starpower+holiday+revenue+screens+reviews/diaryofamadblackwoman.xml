         <snippet>A very curious and very entertaining mix, the Labradoodle of inspirational romantic-comedy-melodramas.</snippet>

         <snippet>A bad movie so over-the-top that at moments it's almost good - or, at least, more arresting than it has any right to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the jokes are obvious and the romance formulaic, a good-natured sensibility saves the film from being too hokey. The individual parts may not work, but the sum remains entertaining.</snippet>

         <snippet>As preposterously awkward, naïve and contrived as this movie is, it's still a curious sort of pleasure to witness-especially the gospel singing scenes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Harris and particularly Elise give over-the-top performances that bring Diary to the edge of soap opera.</snippet>

         <snippet>An ungainly hodgepodge of vaudeville-style comedy, turgid soap-operatics, and joyful epiphanies of gospel-flavored uplift.</snippet>

         <snippet>Diary rather sloppily blends melodrama and spiritual uplift with crass comedy, sometimes in the same scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>The stylistic discontinuities and pile-driver excesses can be off-putting for an outsider like me, but for fans this may well be part of the appeal.</snippet>

         <snippet>By the film's end, you feel like you've spent two hours rapidly changing channels between a WB sitcom, the gospel-choir segments of the "Ladykillers" remake, an episode of "Law &amp; Order" and a Mexican soap opera.</snippet>

         <snippet>These characters, which Perry worked into the narrative from other stage performances, may have been entertaining in those venues, but they undermine the film.</snippet>

         <snippet>So oblivious to genre that it occupies its own special stylistic niche, if you can imagine such a thing as a romantic revenge farce.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Grandma is not merely wrong for the movie, but fatal to it -- a writing and casting disaster... I've been reviewing movies for a long time, and I can't think of one that more dramatically shoots itself in the foot.</snippet>

         <snippet>The whole three-ring circus winds up in a church for a redemptive finale, but by then, Diary has committed too many sins for even the most generous soul to offer salvation.</snippet>
