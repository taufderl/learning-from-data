         <snippet>Wind Chill is very much Blunt's show - there are no other major characters save Holmes - and she even gets to climb a telephone pole in her Prada heels. Brava!</snippet>

         <snippet>For all its flaws, is an often spooky and imaginative ghost story that contains a genuine creepiness.</snippet>

         <snippet>A moody, spooky tale, rendered with laudable economy.</snippet>

         <snippet>This isn't merely a horror film about things going bump in the night, but a study of the effects of desolation on our sense of personal consciousness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite its failings, Wind Chill represents a road rarely taken by 21st-century American horror films: Original (in the non-remake sense of the term), subtle and restrained.</snippet>

         <snippet>This intermittently effective thriller serves as a rickety vehicle for its two perfectly cast leads, working better as a slow-thawing two-hander than as a chilly ghost story.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jacobs and his writers are notably more interested in creepy atmosphere -- and in contemplating the order of the universe -- than in jump-in-your-seat jolts. But well before day breaks, it's the movieâ€™s plot (which would have made for an outstanding Outer Limits episode) that has come to seem stuck in an endless loop.</snippet>
