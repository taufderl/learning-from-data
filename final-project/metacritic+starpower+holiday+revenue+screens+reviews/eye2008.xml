         <snippet>A quirkily efficient genre exercise that knows exactly where and when to administer its cattle-prod shivers.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's as if, on the umpteenth Asian-horror Xerox, the ink has run dry.</snippet>

         <snippet>This slick effort is effectively creepsome until it bogs down somewhat in plot explication.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, the final act (the Mexico sequences) illustrate where to take a ghost story if you want to exchange old-fashioned horror for a grilled cheese sandwich.</snippet>

         <snippet>Their movie is watchable - never more gratuitously so than when Alba is filmed showering and slipping into a tank top. But we've been here before, no?</snippet>

         <snippet>The most vivid aspect of The Eye is its poster image, that of a huge female eye with a human hand gripping the lower lid from the inside. The least vivid aspect is the way Jessica Alba delivers a simple line of expository dialogue.</snippet>

         <snippet>The major problem is the death of a horror film: It's startling, but not particularly scary.</snippet>

         <snippet>Louder and more literal than its inspiration, The Eye benefits from a spiky performance by Alessandro Nivola as Sydney’s rehabilitation counselor. “Your eyes are not the problem,” he tells her at one point. He is so, so right.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sacrifices the quietly creepy qualities of the original in favor of ramped-up horror film techniques that by now seem distressingly familiar.</snippet>

         <snippet>A tediously noisesome English-language remake of an Asian horror picture that wasn't any great shakes to begin with.</snippet>

         <snippet>The entire movie is an object lesson in diminishing returns: of nagging shock cuts and blaring sound cues used as indiscriminately as joy buzzers; of “look out behind you!” scares that wouldn’t make a Cub Scout flinch; of a blurry visual scheme that was far more terrifying in "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly," where it sought empathy rather than empty sensation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Most unforgivably, this Eye culminates not with the mounting dread and spectacular tragedy of the original film's decidedly downbeat vision, but with the trademark LASIK laziness of Hollywood's stylistically blank remake factory.</snippet>
