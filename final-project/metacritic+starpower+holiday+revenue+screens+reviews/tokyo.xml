         <snippet>The entries aren't equally strong, of course, but each comes from a sharp outsider's perspective, approaching Tokyo as a strange, mysterious organism that infects the populace.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tokyo! is a must-see for the Gondry segment, and a strange, diverting pleasure for the rest.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps it is inevitable as three foreign directors train their lenses on that unique island culture of the East that all three are propelled by fantasy or science fiction, and suggest more alienation from Tokyo than affection for the great city.</snippet>

         <snippet>Both in its parts and in the sum of them Tokyo! is playfully and sometimes disorientingly apocalyptic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though these vignettes appear frivolous and inconsequential when set beside the directors' features, they will tickle the funny bones of a general audience. A safe choice for fantastic fests, worldwide cinemas will open to the kind of audiences who bought tickets to see "Paris J'taime" or "To Each His Own Cinema."</snippet>

         <snippet>Falling somewhere between the horrors of Three … Extremes and the beauties of Eros, this triptych of short films set in and underscored by the titular megalopolis is a gorgeous, sprawling mess.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you've seen "Paris, je t'aime" or "New York Stories," you know the rate of return on these urban omnibuses is variable, and so it is here. Go in expecting minor pleasures and you'll be fine.</snippet>

         <snippet>Do these films reflect actual aspects of modern Tokyo? The hikikomori epidemic is apparently real enough, but the other two segments seem more deliberately fantastical. The entertainment value? Medium to high: "Merde." Tokyo? Still standing.</snippet>

         <snippet>An uneven but enjoyable trio of films that take affectionate (and sometimes literal) aim at the Japanese capital.</snippet>

         <snippet>This isn't an art house crowd pleaser along the lines of the 2006 "Paris, je t'aime," a freewheeling mixed bag of shorts made by the likes of Olivier Assayas, Wes Craven and Alfonso Cuarón. Tokyo! demands more patience, patience that it sometimes doesn't deserve.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite the stories' brief running times, they don't manage to generate much interest or make much sense.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tokyo, if anything, becomes more of a mystery after Tokyo! than it was before.
That's the strength and curse of the film. If you can't find real connections between its disparate stories, you can always make them up yourself. But if that kind of film frustrates you, think twice before booking a ticket to Tokyo!</snippet>
