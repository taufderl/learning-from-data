         <snippet>Kang's marvelously assured feature debut is a subtle adaptation of Ed Lin's acclaimed novel "Waylaid."</snippet>

         <snippet>Like the best independent films, The Motel realizes that life is made up of minor pleasures and tiny epiphanies, not sweeping character arcs or big dramatic moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>There were half a dozen occasions, maybe more, when I roared out loud with laughter. This just may be a filmmaker with great things in him; this one's pretty damn good.</snippet>

         <snippet>Michael Kang's small, perfectly observed portrait of Ernest Chin (Jeffrey Chyau), a Chinese-American boy who lives and works in a dingy downscale motel operated by his mother, captures the glum desperation of inhabiting the biological limbo of early adolescence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike so many indie films, Michael Kang's gently empathetic debut embraces eccentricity without drowning in its own hip irony.</snippet>

         <snippet>Michael Kang makes an impressive feature directorial debut with The Motel. But the person to keep an eye on is Jeffrey Chyau, a student at the Bronx High School of Science, who is a delight in the lead role.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's Kang's first feature and it suffers from rocky moments and an unsure eye, but his sense of detail is rich with prickly contradictions and he resists tidying up the story.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pleasant and surprisingly hard-edged coming-of-age indie film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kang balances the uproariously comic with the profoundly sad, and the two tones amplify each other with subtlety.</snippet>

         <snippet>Indie coming-of-age dramas are not exactly an endangered species, but Michael Kang's debut drama is an admirably intelligent and modest example of the genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>By not romanticizing its despairing yet humanistic outlook, The Motel presents a moment-by-moment emotional recap of almost anyone's formative years while simultaneously issuing a stinging reminder on the impossibility of fully outgrowing adolescence's uncertain searching.</snippet>

         <snippet>The backdrop of this seedy motel is just the perfect place to illustrate the awkward times of early teen life.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Motel offers a fresh take on characters and conventions, and compels interest with shrewd, sympathy-inspiring storytelling.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's little originality in the joy rides, first kisses, and clashes with bullies, yet this 2005 debut feature by writer-director Michael Kang captures the small triumphs of a boy becoming a man.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Motel, Michael Kang's modest Sundance applause reaper, doesn't deserve to be shotgunned for the sins of 30 other movies. But the underwhelming syncopation of make-nice clich√©s is too familiar.</snippet>
