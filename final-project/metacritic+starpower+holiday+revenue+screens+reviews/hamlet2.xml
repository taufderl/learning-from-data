         <snippet>Funny excuses an awful lot, and at its best, Hamlet 2 is nothing short of hilarious.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a movie, Hamlet 2 is lively, energetically daft, and very, very scrappy -- a broader, more loony-tunes knockoff of "Waiting for Guffman."</snippet>

         <snippet>Occasionally sloppy, with a finale so abrupt and incoherent that it feels like something is missing. But it's also pleasantly odd and truly funny, and it builds in strength as it goes along.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like its low-key star, Hamlet 2 is more likely to elicit quiet chuckles than raucous laughter.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's Coogan's breakthrough star performance that holds it all together. He's sensational.</snippet>

         <snippet>Coogan's screen persona is vain, dim, angry, and deeply miserable, and his handful of scenes here with a smilingly harsh Catherine Keener are little masterpieces of comic sadomasochism.</snippet>

         <snippet>Arquette wander in and out of frame, but like everyone else in this film, they're eclipsed by Coogan's gloriously unhinged performance, which has the lunatic, semi-meta tone of a parody within a parody.</snippet>

         <snippet>A rather mediocre experience, offering sporadic laughs but never achieving the level of consistent humor necessary to make this memorable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Attaining somewhat of a bad parody of a comedy, screenwriters Andrew Fleming and Pam Brady have slapped together a string of gags in a hit-and-miss dither. Some of it is quite brainy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mostly, though, there's the endlessly resourceful, endlessly inventive, bedazzling Mr. Coogan. Hamlet Schmamlet. Not since "Death of a Salesman" has failure been quite so entertaining.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the new comedy Hamlet 2, Coogan comes perilously close to wearing out his welcome. It's actually a pretty fascinating sight.</snippet>

         <snippet>Amusing but unevenly inspired tale of a deluded high school drama teacher's attempt to stage a career-saving extravaganza has some laughs, to be sure.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hamlet 2 is as needy as its hero -- because it wants not to be probing or profound or even witty but, above all else, to be loved.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's an unhinged, off-the-wall comedy that will try anything once, an uneven film in which the hits are so dead-on that the misses don't seem to matter.</snippet>

         <snippet>So wearying that it makes you feel duped for being open to it in the first place. Hamlet 2 works so hard at being entertaining, in that quirky, Indie 101 sense, that it just grinds you down.</snippet>

         <snippet>Much like the play within it, Hamlet 2 is lousy. The main difference is that the play is SUPPOSED to be awful. The movie about the play is supposed to be funny.</snippet>
