         <snippet>The film is more than a lesson about overcoming bigotry and ignorance. It's also just a beautifully animated romp through the world of Pooh as created by A.A. Milne.</snippet>

         <snippet>The gentle story, told via old-fashioned "flat" animation, is perfect for the very youngest viewers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Frank Nissen strikes a nice balance between slapstick and sentiment, and I'll admit to getting a bit choked up at the appropriate moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's something refreshing about a traditional animated movie that tells an old-fashioned story without attempting to win over adults with double entendres or pop-culture references.</snippet>

         <snippet>This Disney film is all pretty simple, with messages about bigotry and ignorance, friendship and growing up. But at least they don't hit you over the head with them.</snippet>

         <snippet>Delivered without irony or subtext but lots of gentle humour, a kind of family fare that is rare on the big screen these days.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sticking closely to formula, Disney delivers a sweet script and charming storybook backgrounds, with serviceable, if sappy, songs from Carly Simon.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's as notable for what it isn't as for what it is, but in a field full of loud, obnoxious fare, its easygoing affability qualifies as a welcome change of pace.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pooh's Heffalump Movie is a harmless little ''ex-po-tition'' (to use a Pooh-ism). Still, making this your kids' first Pooh experience would be like weaning them on New Coke.</snippet>

         <snippet>So insubstantial that it practically evaporates on screen, Pooh's Heffalump Movie likely will play best with toddlers and pre-schoolers easily amused by bright colors, merry songs and lovable, huggable toon animals.</snippet>

         <snippet>Still, it's hard not to long for the Pooh stories of old, those endearingly anarchic little tales that captured the wonder of a child's world without ever once condescending to it.</snippet>
