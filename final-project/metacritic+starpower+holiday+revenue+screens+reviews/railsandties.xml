         <snippet>The film's best and most carefully shaded performance belongs to Bacon.</snippet>

         <snippet>I found the opening third tremendously intriguing and involving, I thought the emotions were so real they could be touched, but then the film lost its way and fell into the clutches of sentimental melodrama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Reserved, careful and largely predictable in the way it plays out its wrenching emotional crises.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alison Eastwood's debut feature is slow, deliberate, assured, and shot with a graceful feel for place--none of which is enough to overcome the creaky themes that tie this hackneyed domestic drama together with fearsome symmetry.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alison Eastwood, whose good looks and last name have served her well as a Hollywood actress, makes her directing debut with this mediocre cancer drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>While it features three strong performance and the debut of a promising filmmaker, the story line is obvious and rather melodramatic.</snippet>

         <snippet>As lovely as some of the footage looks and as committed as are the three lead performances, they serve only to make Rails &amp; Ties play like an exceptionally well-acted and well-made Lifetime movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>The only conceivable reason for Warner Bros. to (barely) release this mush is as a favor to Clint Eastwood, whose daughter Alison directed.</snippet>
