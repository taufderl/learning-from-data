         <snippet>Watching Nina's Tragedies, an Israeli film that pocketed 11 of its country's Oscar-equivalents, is a rare but almost perverse experience.</snippet>

         <snippet>With masterful tonal balance and control, and a visual sophistication as yet unusual among Israeli directors, Gabizon catches both the absurdity and the sadness of what it means to live with such daily threat and confusion.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has too much depth, too much freshness and imagination ever to be adequately described in any of its aspects as merely "quirky" or "off the wall."</snippet>

         <snippet>Israeli director Savi Gabizon has created a nuanced coming-of-age portrait that ought to strike a chord with ­audiences ­everywhere.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not often that good movies have a hole in the center, but Nina's Tragedies labors admirably to develop the strong feelings of longing and heartbreak that unite its damaged souls, however briefly.</snippet>

         <snippet>Overall Nina's Tragedies is another instance of a subject discussed here lately--a foreign film that is seen one way at home and another way abroad.</snippet>

         <snippet>Israeli society is one that has ample experience processing grief, and Nina's Tragedies explores that challenge with humanity and humor.</snippet>

         <snippet>With improbable charm, Gabizon knits it all together, his characters' sexual obsessions and earthiness tempered by a soulful melancholy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gabizon has a great idea. But he ruins it by devoting too much time to colorful but unnecessary characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>The biggest weakness in Nina's Tragedies, is the character of Nadav.  His shadowy presence leaves the movie without a solid center around which to spin its tales.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Israeli academy showered awards--best picture, director, screenplay, editing, cinematography, sound, costumes, actress, supporting actress, supporting actor--on this coming-of-age story, which makes its modest whimsy even harder to get excited about.</snippet>

         <snippet>No amount of style or good acting can disguise the fact that this downbeat Israeli comedy is little more than a sudsy soap-opera with a distinctly unsavory aftertaste.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gabizon never establishes a consistent tone or point of view. Instead, we hop from one episode to the next, with no momentum and no reason to care about these people.</snippet>
