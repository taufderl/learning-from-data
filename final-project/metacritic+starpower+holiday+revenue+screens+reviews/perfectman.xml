         <snippet>In Duff's movies, the question is whether the movie will find enough interesting stuff to compensate for the blandness at the center. The Perfect Man does.</snippet>

         <snippet>But for a lightweight summer romantic comedy, The Perfect Man delivers the goods and includes a couple of scenes that are, surprisingly, fresh and quite funny, both of which, incidentally, involve the music of Styx.</snippet>

         <snippet>I've had the unique pleasure of reviewing almost all of Duff's movies, and if there's one thing to say about the girl, she's consistent: nice, sweet, blond, inoffensive and uninspiring.</snippet>

         <snippet>The premise is patently ridiculous, but the target audience of 12-year-old girls will be too charmed by the genre requisites to care.</snippet>

         <snippet>This cream puff of a romantic comedy is sweet enough, but lack of substance makes it deeply unsatisfying.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even though the supporting cast is likable and the film hits all the beats of its formula, it's weak, as if everyone has been to the well one too many times.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a chick flick with a vengeance but even in its most sentimental moments, stars Hilary Duff and Heather Locklear make this feel-good-about-yourself movie feel ... well, good.</snippet>

         <snippet>For most part, The Perfect Man is too bland to merit anything more censorious than a stifled yawn.</snippet>

         <snippet>Where Locklear's careful, clipped delivery confirms that she's better suited for TV stardom than the movies, every time Duff opens her mouth, she confirms that her natural home is in magazines. Or voicing animated squirrels. Either one would work.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rosman and Wendkos run dry of ideas in the film's inert, overextended finale, when the "Believe in yourself" speeches grow so thick that even the Duff-devoted may start rolling their eyes.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's one thing to be said for The Perfect Man: It confirms my belief that I'll never need to see another Hilary Duff movie until (1) she turns 30 or (2) she plays a crackhead in "Requiem for a Dream II."</snippet>

         <snippet>The Perfect Man is like Teen People come to life. It's perfectly PG, and it's probably not the worst thing a young lady could see, depending on your criteria. Cinematically, it's like watching your lawn grow.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once upon a time there were made-for-television movies. Now there are made-for-television movies for movie theaters. The Perfect Man, another anemic Hilary Duff vehicle, is a case in point.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Perfect Man crawls hand over bloody hand up the stony face of this plot, while we in the audience do not laugh because it is not nice to laugh at those less fortunate than ourselves, and the people in this movie are less fortunate than the people in just about any other movie I can think of, simply because they are in it.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's just the matter of facing it: that The Perfect Man is just something slapped together -- by people who don't care, for an audience they figure will care even less.</snippet>

         <snippet>Most of this movie is beyond lame. It almost makes "A Cinderella Story" -- the ever-mugging Duff's surprise hit of last summer -- look like a real movie by comparison.</snippet>
