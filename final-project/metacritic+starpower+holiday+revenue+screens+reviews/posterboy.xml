         <snippet>The film's strident tone also serves to undermine its generally above-average performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Zak Tucker is a bit too fond of jump cuts as signifiers of edginess. Still, when the material doesn't get in the way he's pretty good at getting across the emotional content.</snippet>

         <snippet>Underproduced and compromised by an uneven script and a tendency to descend into melodrama, the DV-lensed feature nonetheless is well acted and directed with confidence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even with satisfying performances from the principal actors, Poster Boy is longer on energy than focus.</snippet>

         <snippet>Some clunky writing and a distracting subplot limit the effectiveness of this ambitious low-budget indie. Great idea for a movie, though.</snippet>

         <snippet>A polemic masquerading as a movie, Poster Boy unspools like a humorless lecture on right-wing homophobia.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although audiences will admire the film's do-it-yourself energy and commitment, Poster Boy finally collapses of its own contrived weight, deflating just when it should soar into madcap -- or at least thoughtful -- satire.</snippet>

         <snippet>An overwrought story of American politics and image-making that really only gets interesting in the final act.</snippet>

         <snippet>As irritating as an ideological college student, this earnest debut from Zak Tucker is determined to teach us a lesson about right and wrong.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rather than creating believable characters engaged in nuanced conflict, Boy proffers a pair of obvious symbols and hopes that they'll make a statement about the personal and the political.</snippet>

         <snippet>Working from a preachy, clumsy script that's full of gaping holes in logic, plot and character development, director Zak Tucker is also handicapped by a cast filled with actors who seem to be in their first year of acting school.</snippet>
