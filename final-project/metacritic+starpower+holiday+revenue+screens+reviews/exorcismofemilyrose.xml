         <snippet>Some genuine shocks punctuate The Exorcism of Emily Rose, an unusually intelligent genre item that manages to mix full-bore horror with courtroom drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>With a cast like this, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a superior performance vehicle and on that count alone is never less than riveting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plays like a modern-day inversion of "Inherit the Wind," highlighting an astonishing shift in the American legal system over the last 80 years.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fans expecting horror won't want a thought-provoking, well-acted courtroom drama about the intersection of religious belief and the law.</snippet>

         <snippet>Emily Rose is the thinking person's demon possession movie, which presents a chilling case history that's hard to explain away.</snippet>

         <snippet>Somehow the movie really never takes off into the riveting fascination we expect in the opening scenes. Maybe it cannot; maybe it is too faithful to the issues it raises to exploit them.</snippet>

         <snippet>Part "Law &amp; Order," part "The Omen," the movie doesn't trust the audience to follow serious theological and legal discussion without a spook hook.</snippet>

         <snippet>Take away the performances, and all that would be left is a cheapish B-grade motion picture.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fashioning a hybrid of a courtroom drama and a horror film that is suspenseful and scary requires a clear vision and directorial finesse. Rose lacks both. But the performances are topnotch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Could have been both a gripping courtroom drama and a chilling "is she or isn’t she?" horror tale. What we have instead is a movie that drifts, almost unmanned, from plot point to plot point.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a pretense of even-handedness. The true story has been reduced to a case for faith. It merely sacrifices all reason to get there.</snippet>

         <snippet>The script is a lifeless succession of attorney-client debates and stormy horror flashbacks, though I had a good time watching Jennifer Carpenter, a comic Buffy type in "White Chicks" and "D.E.B.S.," hurl herself around as the title character.</snippet>

         <snippet>While not especially good - judged strictly on its cinematic merits, it ranges from O.K. to god-awful - it is still a fascinating cultural document in the age of intelligent design.</snippet>

         <snippet>Derrickson's characters are reduced to ciphers in a theological debate. Long wedges of the film are simply a discussion about the relative merits of science and superstition. Carpenter, as the sick girl, puts in the best performance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Part courtroom drama, part otherworldly shocker, the film basically restages the Scopes Monkey Trial and comes out once more against Mr. Darrow, and it's got the spine-twisting, tongues-speaking, devil-channeling hellion to prove it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Allegedly it's based on a true story, which is believable only because the outcome is so unsatisfying it carries the dull metallic tang of real-life ambiguity. And that's neither scary nor stimulating.</snippet>

         <snippet>Creepy enough at first, this relatively gore-free film gradually becomes a stifling talk-fest in which superb actors drone on for so long about the nature of belief that one longs for a juror to spew a little pea soup.</snippet>

         <snippet>Derrickson's staid direction, coupled with Wilkinson’s sad-sack priest and a general air of dreariness make for a courtroom thriller that’s somewhat less apocalyptic than the "L.A. Law" episode involving the death of Benny's mom.</snippet>
