         <snippet>At times too movieish, yet Ashkenazi creates a memorable figure: a spy who operates - admirably - out of the most unyielding nationalist conviction, only to learn that he needs to let some of that conviction go.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fox keeps the suspense story at a low boil throughout, allowing the politics to emerge as the characters deepen.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its suggestion that Israel, of all nations, should know better than to persecute minorities within and across its borders, give the film a thrilling universal appeal.</snippet>

         <snippet>There’s something happening here and it isn’t exactly clear. What is clear is that Eytan Fox may yet make a great film for the 21st century.</snippet>

         <snippet>Remains gripping until the final 15 minutes, when a series of sudden, unjustified plot twists leave us shaking our heads.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it is marred by an implausible climax and a cloying conclusion, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you, marking the director as a talent to watch.</snippet>

         <snippet>The new Israeli film Walk on Water is complex and paradoxical, at times frustrating but always involving. Something like the country that produced it.</snippet>

         <snippet>All political thrillers, good or less good, have moral implications...Walk on Water, one of the better ones, has grave moral implications and does not ignore them or merely utilize them.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fox's film seems to say that the kind of saintly purity that would enable one to walk on water -- or to kill with impunity and without repercussions -- doesn't exist.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though its characters aren't terribly complex, and its plot holds few surprises, the screenplay (in English, German, and Hebrew) amounts to a worthy treatise on the need to forgo revenge.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately for Fox, the softer his movie gets, the more Ashkenazi and Berger grow to resemble Ben Stiller and Ashton Kutcher in some unreleased, homo-erotic comic romance.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Israeli film works best in isolated spots early on as a series of intriguing character studies. Upon reaching to become a lesson to the world, however, Walk on Water goes off the deep end.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fox falters a bit with the narrative, but offers a fascinating treatment of the issues facing the descendents of Jewish victims and their German persecutors, as well as one of the most chilling birthday parties ever filmed.</snippet>

         <snippet>When it unexpectedly shifts back into its initial thriller mode, Walk On Water loses in human drama what it gains in tidiness, revealing itself as a film that carries more weight in its light scenes than its heavy moments can sustain.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fox can't decide if Walk on Water is a terrorist thriller or a gay buddy story, and neither can the viewer.</snippet>
