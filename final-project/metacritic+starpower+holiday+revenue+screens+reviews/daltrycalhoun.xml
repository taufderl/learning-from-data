         <snippet>The soundtrack, which ranges from Johnny Cash to Serge Gainsbourg to the Wu-Tang Clan, is admirably eclectic but can't be said to pull things together.</snippet>

         <snippet>Seriously flawed - and choppily edited in the worst Harvey Scissorhands style - but there are enough good moments to anticipate a second film from writer-director Katrina Holden Bronson, whose parents were Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland.</snippet>

         <snippet>Daltry Calhoun (Johnny Knoxville) urges you to "get high on grass--the legal kind." But to find anything funny in director Katrina Holden Bronson's debut, you're going to want the illegal kind.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although the film starts off somewhat amusingly, the first-time feature director Katrina Holden Bronson (who also wrote the unbalanced script) seems to have spent more energy assembling the overbearing soundtrack than expanding on her characters' fractured relationships.</snippet>

         <snippet>Aims for whimsy and poignancy and mostly comes up empty.</snippet>

         <snippet>Traub does her plucky best, coming off as part Judy Blume heroine, part post-WB hipster, and she provides the film with its few and infrequent moments of emotional truth.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the parlance of "The Player," Katrina Holden Bronson's Daltry Calhoun would be pitched as "Because of Winn-Dixie" meets "Napoleon Dynamite," and that is definitely not a good thing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Daltry Calhoun's saving grace comes in the form of a snappy compilation soundtrack that spans from Johnny Cash to Serge Gainsbourg, a feat of all-inclusiveness that renders the film a moot point at best.</snippet>
