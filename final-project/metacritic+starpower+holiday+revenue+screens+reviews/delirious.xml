         <snippet>This is the best DiCillo movie I've seen, and he's made some good ones ("Box of Moonlight," "The Real Blonde").</snippet>

         <snippet>An all-or-nothing perf from old DiCillo hand Steve Buscemi and a script that leaves no ironical stone unturned make this laugh-out-loud fare.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tom DiCillo’s angry comedy Delirious subjects modern celebrity culture to a microscopic examination that shows the toxic virus of fame squirming and multiplying under its lens.</snippet>

         <snippet>DiCillo's short, sharp snapshot about celebrity and life on the fringe has nothing new to say, but it says it with considerable charm and affection.</snippet>

         <snippet>A story peopled by flawed archetypes, it's an achingly funny film that is also a little sad around the edges.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The story's surprises range from clever to annoying, but DiCillo manages to hold it all together with his consistently amusing cast members, who make you laugh at their characters' self-absorbed folly.</snippet>

         <snippet>Agently attitudinous, generally zippy urban fairy tale about pop stars and the hangers-on who coddle (or prey upon) them, Tom DiCillo's Delirious is a mild "Midnight Cowboy," a minor "King of Comedy," and mainly a vehicle for Steve Buscemi as a lower Manhattan–based paparazzo.</snippet>

         <snippet>The jokes are sparse and predictable, and the storytelling is, too. But Buscemi and Gershon have great fun with their roles, and Pitt is strangely agreeable about the whole thing. Bully for him.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everyone here is obsessed with finding "the real thing" - the next hot actor, the next revealing paparazzi shot, the lover or the friend who'll make it all worthwhile. Everyone settles for the illusion of reality instead. It's prettier, and it doesn't hurt so much.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>It would be nice to see a sharp, funny, penetrating satire of the new, kicked-up culture of empty media fame, but Tom DiCillo's scattershot buddy movie Delirious isn't it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it scores a reasonable share of laughs, Delirious might have been better off if it weren't a comedy at all.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie becomes less fizzy once DeCillo decides to make A Statement (a rather incoherent one at that).</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Purports to give us the lowdown on Manhattan celebrity life, yet it depends so consistently on plot contrivances and other movies (The King of Comedy, Midnight Cowboy, even All About Eve) that it often comes across as wannabe muckraking.</snippet>
