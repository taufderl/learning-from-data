         <snippet>Dorian Blues covers extremely familiar territory, but does so with low-key wit and ingratiating charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eschews the heavy sexual content (and most of the clich√©s) of so many gay films -- it also has a lot of heart.</snippet>

         <snippet>It doesn't open up much new territory, except to eschew much of the dark, frank sexuality that has characterized such recent sexual coming-of-age movies as "Mysterious Skin." Instead, Bardwell offers a cheerful, if sometimes strenuously earnest, take on a subject that seems overdue for a lighthearted touch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bardwell manages a sincere portrait of what it's like to be young and closeted.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sharp performances and writing lend it a fresh appeal well above this genre's average.</snippet>

         <snippet>With some gentle humor that will delight the "Napoleon Dynamite" set, Dorian Blues lights a natural little footpath between two ways of living.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its moments of comic relief overly exaggerated and at odds with its realistic tone, Dorian Blues is at its best at its most serious.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its smarmy resolution just doesn't work; the lessons learned are a bit too medicinal. But we're willing to forgive, since it's otherwise a good-natured and enjoyable ride.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even if the story is hackneyed, it's hackneyed in a warm and universal way.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's third act goes astray as the storyline shifts to Dorian's dating problems, which seem an overextended tangent to his coming-out story. Still, the film has a lot of playful dialogue and pixillated montages.</snippet>

         <snippet>The buoyant McMillan is a charming presence, but he's entirely miscast as a character described as moody and angry.</snippet>

         <snippet>Inhabiting the breezeway between the sweet sincerity of "Beautiful Thing" and the didacticism of an ABC "Afterschool Special," this upstate New York coming-out saga will warm PFLAG hearts and kindle empathy in those who've had to tread the family-drama-churned waters of small-town gaydom.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dorian Blues is full of similarly rigged moments, but there are genuine chuckles, and a palpably heartfelt final scene between Dorian and his mom ends the tale on a powerful note.</snippet>
