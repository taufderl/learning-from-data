         <snippet>It appears to have been made from the inside, not only of the characters but of the historical situation in which they struggle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bolstered by a beautifully shaded performance by Karanovic as a woman attempting to escape the torments of her past while securing a future for her daughter, Zbanic's film begs a pretty complex question: Is a love story possible in the aftermath of torture and genocide? The answer appears to be a tentative yes, both on the levels of the film and filmmaking, but it isn't easy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zbanic, who lived through the Bosnian war in Sarajevo, is an unusual talent. Here, she makes us feel the hell her characters once lived through as well as the leftover, stinging pain of today.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a spare and plainly told story, and it is that plainness that gives it so much punch.</snippet>

         <snippet>While excellent films like Danis Tanovic's Oscar-winning "No Man's Land" and Vinko Bresan's "Witnesses" have dealt with the war itself, few have dealt with the aftermath, and none with the aching power and empathy of Grbavica: The Land of My Dreams.</snippet>

         <snippet>The admirable feminist agenda occasionally trips up the narrative, but the film's performances keep it on track.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mirjana Karanovic (Esma) and Luna Mijovic (Sara) give powerful performances as Zbanic imbues a simple story with a powerful commentary on the Bosnian war's devastating impact on the innocent.</snippet>

         <snippet>The dramatic conflicts are soapy and unsubtle, but Karanovic pours intense authority into Esma's scarred psyche.</snippet>

         <snippet>Grbavica is a womanly movie in the best sense: Zbanic has a deeply feminine sense of how crisis gets filtered through the domesticity of daily life.</snippet>

         <snippet>The power of "Grbavica" is not the arc of its story line, but the fullness of the world Zbanic creates.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zbanic is such an acute observer of women's lives in their intimate details, and constructs such fine scenes, that I think this might be the best film to emerge from the aftermath of the Balkan conflict.</snippet>

         <snippet>Throughout Grbavica the desire to forget and the need to remember are at loggerheads. At Saraâ€™s school the psychological wounds of the war are being handed down to her generation through the separation of heroes and nonheroes. Fathers pass their weapons down to their sons. Even as you leave a war behind, you bring it with you.</snippet>

         <snippet>Grbavica is a surprisingly vibrant, at times even joyous, study of the way life goes on even after the most intolerable suffering.</snippet>

         <snippet>Central performance by Mirjana Karanovic is instantly endearing. Unfortunately, film coasts on thesp's ability to evoke sympathy and leaves her stranded in this yarn that's all setup and little payoff.</snippet>
