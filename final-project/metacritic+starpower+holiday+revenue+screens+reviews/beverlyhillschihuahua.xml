         <snippet>Graced with unusually expressive and seamless voice work by Drew Barrymore and George Lopez, the best of its kind since "Babe."</snippet>

         <snippet>Depending on your tolerance for talking Chihuahuas, this could make for a fun family night out.</snippet>

         <snippet>The picture might not be as fresh and clever as it could have been, but its spirited voice cast delivers the whole enchilada.</snippet>

         <snippet>Okay, the concept for the movie is admittedly lame, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with watching a passel of adorable pooches wrinkle their brows and bark while human voices come out of their mouths.</snippet>

         <snippet>This being Disney, wholesome character-building messages abound, but for once they're freshly spun as cautions against stereotyping both ethnic and canine.</snippet>

         <snippet>A filthy-rich fantasy for these cash-strapped times, Beverly Hills Chihuahua features the voices of Drew Barrymore and much of the industry's top Latino talent in a live-action talking-dog lark that should please young pups.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's very slick and small children will enjoy it, but it has little of its model's special magic.</snippet>

         <snippet>As multimillion-dollar frivolities about the pets of the ruling class go, Chihuahua is reasonably diverting. As one that happens to be opening in the middle of an economic meltdown, its mere existence feels utterly insane.</snippet>

         <snippet>Performances are rather beside the point in a movie where dogs carry the acting burden, but Perabo is especially bland.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is not a movie for anyone who's aged past the "Oh! Cute!" phase of moviegoing. It's paced for little minds with short attention spans.</snippet>

         <snippet>Coasting on lazy stereotypes, the script basically ends where it started, teaching young viewers that it's really not so bad to be a spoiled bitchy puppy.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's hard to go wrong with a movie full of talking dogs. But the makers of Beverly Hills Chihuahua sure try.</snippet>

         <snippet>Isn't terrible. OK, it's kind of terrible, but it's a talking-dog movie, and anyone who goes to a talking-dog movie without being prepared to step in poop deserves to ruin his shoes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite its superficial lip-service to self-actualization/realization, there has to be more to life than what Beverly Hills Chihuahua is putting out there, which is fit for neither man nor beast.</snippet>

         <snippet>While George Lopez, Cheech Marin, and Paul Rodriguez are funny men, it's amazing how boring these Latin-shtick cutups can be when none of them gets a single good line.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even a film as shabby and humdrum as Beverly Hills Chihuahua, which never musters up the wit and beauty of a single frame of "Lady and the Tramp," is not without its pleasures.</snippet>
