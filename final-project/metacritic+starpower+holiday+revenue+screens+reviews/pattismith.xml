         <snippet>A knowledge of Smith's landmark contribution as a rock 'n' roll pioneer is not essential, and the film should be a joy for anyone interested in pop culture of the past 40 years.</snippet>

         <snippet>Frequently beautiful and intermittently haunting and could be called a meditation on aging and mortality, an intimate study of a peculiar variety of fame and a portrait of a genuinely remarkable person.</snippet>

         <snippet>A lovely, drifty first feature that feels less like a documentary and more like an act of rapturous devotion.</snippet>

         <snippet>If one thing holds the picture back, it’s the self-conscious album-cover aesthetic of Sebring’s visual approach.</snippet>

         <snippet>This intimate portrait of the so-called godmother of punk is aimed at viewers who are keenly fascinated by Smith.</snippet>

         <snippet>This isn't a performance film, and it is far from a definitive portrait of the androgynous performer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Steven Sebring spent a decade making this documentary about the punk poet, and it shows.</snippet>

         <snippet>Impossibly long and angular, with a brutally beautiful face, she represents something that's been rare in the popular culture in the past decade: an artist with a voice and a vision.</snippet>

         <snippet>The textured, thoughtful results may prove too cerebral and abstract for audiences beyond Smith's hardcore followers,</snippet>

         <snippet>When embraced on its own terms, the film will provide an ironic bridge for those who want to share a greater closeness with Smith.</snippet>

         <snippet>We don't learn too many specifics of Smith's brilliant career, and only a die-hard fan will find all of it vitally interesting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Most frustratingly, Smith's powerful music is heard only in snatches.</snippet>

         <snippet>The paltry amount of live performances is a crime. In some ways, Smith singing "Gloria" live would've been all the context anyone would ever need.</snippet>

         <snippet>109 mostly black-and-white minutes of punk's wet nurse floating through the modern world while endlessly ruminating on mortality, art, and the occasional bodily function. Problem is, there's nary a hint of context, even with biographic essentials.</snippet>
