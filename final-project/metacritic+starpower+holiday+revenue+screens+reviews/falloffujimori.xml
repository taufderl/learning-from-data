         <snippet>It's a fascinating, haunting, unintentionally gruesome spectacle with, as Perry has said, echoes of Shakespearean tragedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fujimori comes off as amiable and in full denial, recalling the positive headlines of his presidency - and there were many - while laying the scandals off on Montesinos.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the end justifies the means, it would be hard to deny that the legacy of Alberto Fujimori, the disgraced former President of Peru, is largely triumphant.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perry - who also produced, wrote and lensed - was able to talk Fujimori into letting her interview him on camera in Japan. He puts on a great show.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although theyâ€™re not revealing in a "Barbara Walters gets the guest to cry" sense, the interview segments are queasily fascinating.</snippet>

         <snippet>A confoundingly mercurial figure, Fujimori is a fascinating subject. But in her focus on the man, Perry fails to paint a broader picture of a racially diverse and extremely complex country.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ellen Perry seems keenly aware, there is really no need to embellish the Fujimori story, which has enough unlikely melodrama for six Italian operas.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Fall of Fujimori is more-or less-than the flip side to last week's Film Forum Peru primer "State of Fear": It's a prismatic shudder, a maddening manifestation of historical ambivalence.</snippet>

         <snippet>To her credit, Perry isn't taken in by Fujimori's attempts to distance himself from the controversies that plagued his presidency. Helped by Kim Roberts's excellent editing, she succinctly chronicles his unlikely ascent and subsequent collapse.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perry creates an objective yet not overly dry character study of the man, now a fugitive living in Japan, as he recalls his days in power.</snippet>
