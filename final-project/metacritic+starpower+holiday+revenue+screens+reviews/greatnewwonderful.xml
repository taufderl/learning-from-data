         <snippet>The stories are eye-opening and heartwarming at the same time, but you'll be moved less by empathy for the characters than by the summoning of your own emotional memories. This movie is personal.</snippet>

         <snippet>A quieter, less melodramatic piece of work than last year's "Crash," and arguably a better one.</snippet>

         <snippet>Writer Sam Catlin and director Danny Leiner have fashioned an alert, shrewdly observed portrait of a moment in time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Overall, there's a patchwork quality to the movie, as if a batch of half-finished short stories were filmed before their time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Working from a stagy script by Sam Catlin, director Danny Leiner uses a dainty palette of tristesse (untouched when he made Dude, Where's My Car?) to suggest that the shadow of 9/11 makes every discontent more pathetic.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a mixed bag of lozenges, some sweet, some tart and others that just melt away into nothing.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story lines don't intersect in that schematic, "Crash"-y way, which is refreshing. Less refreshing is the neat-and-tidiness of the individual exchanges in Sam Catlin's script.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie falls short of the grandeur it's reaching for, but if you're looking for balm to soothe your frazzled nerves, you may be able to scrape some from the movie's rawer edges.</snippet>

         <snippet>The new 9/11 movies aim to rekindle feelings that most of us have, by necessity, moved beyond. But thereâ€™s more than one way to move beyond, as suggested by the spottily affecting ensemble psycho-comedy The Great New Wonderful.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is hard to feel much warmth toward people whose most salient feature is their disconnection from reality.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, screenwriter Sam Catlin and director Danny Leiner make the unexpected mistake of being too subtle.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the future, more and more filmmakers will do exactly what The Great New Wonderful has done: conceal their lack of ideas by bringing up 9/11.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ironically, Leiner's two monuments to pothead delirium seem vastly more coherent than this hazy attempt to mine the zeitgeist, a film every bit as pointed as its nounless title.</snippet>
