         <snippet>A beautifully realized small film of understated power.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not really original stuff, and there are few genuine surprises, but Painter skillfully layers visual details and off-the-cuff dialogue into a smart, condescension-free piece on small towns and the complicated lives they contain. The standout here is the always-wonderful Seymour (Hotel Rwanda, Birth).</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's real star is the stunning Montana landscape, beautifully captured by cinematographer Paul Ryan.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's some nice low-key work amid the uneven performances, but the Montana-shot film's key strength is its sense of place.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its lovely scenery and languid pacing, has a warmth and a naturalness that transcend its overheated material.</snippet>

         <snippet>A classic case of overreaching, Steal Me boasts unorthodox camera angles, dramatic shifts in its palette and a generally adventurous visual style. What it lacks is believable dialogue, credible relationships and a serious foundation for its overripe psychology.</snippet>

         <snippet>Steal Me suffers from a distinct charisma vacuum at the center, which makes it easy to linger on its many shortcomings, especially its stilted dialogue and pseudo-poetic, pseudo-philosophical narration.</snippet>

         <snippet>There’s enough character development for a 20-minute short, and 75 additional minutes are manufactured with slight variations on the same scenes in different rooms of the house.</snippet>

         <snippet>The teen actors grin twitchily as if tickled by sudden growth spurts, but apparently nothing can hurt their chances with the females in this libidinous zip code.</snippet>

         <snippet>Solid performances can't save Melissa Painter's pretentious teen drama Steal Me, which plays like a cross between "Dangerous Skin" (without the gay sex) and "Picnic" (without the production values or credible situations).</snippet>

         <snippet>Whether it's the guitar-strum soundtrack, "lyrical" cornfield shots, or arrhythmic performances, Steal Me has at least one indie-film cliché too many.</snippet>
