         <snippet>This might be the only documentary that will appeal to punks and Mormons alike.</snippet>

         <snippet>You're left with the bewilderment and joy on Kane's face as he plays the old songs, and the sense of ghosts just behind his back.</snippet>

         <snippet>So rich, moving and surprising that a familiar story starts to feel new again. The details, the personalities and the final twist grab you until you're left truly shaken and inspired.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it is small in scale and lasts only 78 minutes, New York Doll, like any documentary, goes places we expect it to and places we do not. As journeys go, this is one to treasure.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kane was nicknamed "Killer" because of his playing style -- and New York Doll has a killer surprise ending that may leave even hard-core punkers reaching for the Kleenex.</snippet>

         <snippet>This makes for a modestly touching journey, but New York Doll, in its wafer-thin way, is an oxymoron: a hagiographic tribute to a rocker with more passion than talent.</snippet>

         <snippet>No matter how well you think you know this tale, you do not know it at all. It offers the oldest clich√©s polished up like some brand-new thing by director Greg Whiteley.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, this is less a film about a rock and roller than a film about a Mormon. And Napoleon Dynamite it ain't.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film paints an affectionate portrait of a wry, somewhat addled man whose hard-partying past was in stark contrast with his later life - a fluffy cat nestles in his guitar case while he explains his nickname.</snippet>

         <snippet>A fascinating portrait of a broken rock star picking up the pieces, this misses a few tricks but still entertains.</snippet>
