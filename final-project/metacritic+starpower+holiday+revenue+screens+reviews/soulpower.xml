         <snippet>Soul Power, as aptly and succinctly titled a movie as I have ever seen, takes you to a place where the discipline that produces great popular art is indistinguishable from the ecstasy that art creates.</snippet>

         <snippet>Explodes in a burst of energy, musical chops and an eerie political prescience that makes it feel like something beamed from some past-is-future time warp.</snippet>

         <snippet>Levy-Hinte has said that a great deal more concert footage exists. I can't wait for the expanded version DVD.</snippet>

         <snippet>Period pieces can be marvelous or musty, depending on the period, as well as the piece. Soul Power is marvelous.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's infectious in Soul Power is the almost shocking optimism of its America-meets-Africa '70s world-beat vibe.</snippet>

         <snippet>The idea is to share with us that this show happened. But gluttons for these artists and for music festivals in general might wonder, as I have, whether there's any way the filmmakers might share more of the remaining 123 1/2 hours.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's best seen as a breezy entertainment and a reminder of how potent some of these performers -- many of whom are dead -- were in their primes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Artfully stitched together sans narration, Soul Power stands alongside "Wattstax" as a critical concert film of the Black Power era.</snippet>

         <snippet>Delightfully, Kinshasa's streets are alive with music, and snippets of sidewalk performances are integrated into the movie. The musicians are unidentified, alas, but then after 35 years, the filmmakers probably don't know who they are.</snippet>

         <snippet>While there's an awful lot to like about this infectious celebration of a remarkable event featuring some superb, larger-than-life performers at the top of their game, the enterprise comes across as a bit of a missed opportunity.</snippet>
