         <snippet>What I liked the most about the second "Dozen," was another performance, the one by Alyson Stoner as their daughter Sarah. As a girl poised on the first scary steps of adolescence, she finds the kind of vulnerability and shy hope that Reese Witherspoon projected in "The Man in the Moon."</snippet>

         <snippet>A family comedy that is actually involving, even believable, and manages to be pretty funny too.</snippet>

         <snippet>Compared with Martin's first "Dozen" and the recent mega-family movie "Yours, Mine and Ours," this sequel is Academy Award material.</snippet>

         <snippet>The point isn't really to make you laugh. The film is supposed to make people feel good about their families, and it does a fine job of it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Give Dozen a slight edge to the mournful "Yours, Mine &amp; Ours" as a holiday season bottom-feeder, because Martin and Levy are better at slapstick than Dennis Quaid.</snippet>

         <snippet>What keeps the film afloat (barely) is the sheer charisma of Eugene Levy and the young Alyson Stoner, who manage to find emotion and laughs in the tritest of dialogue and the flimsiest of scenarios.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a discernible lack of enthusiasm from almost everyone involved, and Duff, who's gone from wholesome to haggard in two short years, is flat-out scary.</snippet>

         <snippet>In its absolute commitment to inoffensive, fun-for-the-whole-family entertainment, it's as extreme in its own way as hardcore pornography.</snippet>

         <snippet>A textbook example of how not to mess with success, Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is every bit as forced, synthetic, banal and mawkish as the first edition.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bland, canned but studiously professional sequel retains most of the principals from Fox's family-friendly 2003 hit, including the ever-reliable Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ironically, one of the film's best-developed characters is a mouse: The four-legged "Chizzler" actually has a legitimate story arc with a genuine payoff.</snippet>

         <snippet>Noisy, silly, gratingly upbeat, and piously sentimental, 'Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is what passes for wholesome family entertainment these days. It's the sort of movie to send small children and grandparents out of the theater hugging each other and strong men in search of bourbon.</snippet>

         <snippet>It has virtually nothing in common with the charming book written by the Gilbreths about their turn-of-the-century family and everything to do with making money on DVD rentals.</snippet>

         <snippet>What you have is less a sequel to a not-so-bad remake than yet another remake, this one of that not-so-great 1988 John Candy comedy "The Great Outdoors."</snippet>
