         <snippet>It's terrific! Shot by the brilliant cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle ("Dogville," "28 Days Later," etc.) and anchored by amazing performances from identical (but not conjoined) twins Harry and Luke Treadaway, Brothers of the Head is not a freak show, or a knockoff "Rocky Horror" camp celebration. It's a work of powerful atmosphere and significant mystery. Plus, it rocks.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's pretty weird stuff, and filmmakers Keith Fulton and Luis Pepe embrace it with a layer of cinematic gauze that builds a pounding energy to this hypnotic twisting of rock legend.</snippet>

         <snippet>It ends up seeming more real and more artistically, morally, and spiritually honest than any dozen bedrock documentary films you'd care to name.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yes, this is another faux rock documentary, but one so dramatically and visually textured that it reinvents that decidedly worn genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like a good rock record, Brothers of the Head isn't easily explained. But its original fusion of real and surreal will cling to your cranium for years.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a very tender portrayal of young people
caught up in a blisteringly fast and cynical world, and though their music is
hideous, they are a compelling act.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite some excitingly shot concert footage, one scene begins to feel very much like the next, and it's all rather predictable.</snippet>

         <snippet>So cleverly constructed that it's easy to be taken in and believe these twins really rocked.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is something to see, and when it addresses the mysterious bond connecting creative people, it has an urgent, ugly splendor.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are real thrills here, especially as the Bang Bang starts touring and becomes a minor sensation. But it's a little too hermetic and goopy and humorless and cool to invite you to wrap your arms around it. The Howes shared a single liver, but what this film version of their lives needs is more heart.</snippet>

         <snippet>Feature debut by Yank duo Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe isn't so far from their engrossing docus on Terry Gilliam's filmic adventures, "The Hamster Factor" (1996) and "Lost in La Mancha" (2001), except here the madness and exploitation is part of the music scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thought-provoking as it is, Brothers of the Head keeps its distance, choosing to tell a story about telling stories. But the story itself remains an unexploited gold mine.</snippet>

         <snippet>A fake documentary that barely lets on that its fiction, this devilishly clever film tells the story of conjoined twins who create a minor sensation in Britain on the eve of punk rock.</snippet>

         <snippet>The golden-hued footage is lovingly faked by ace cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, and the straight-faced result is as improbably touching as the Farrelly brothers' underrated "Stuck on You."</snippet>

         <snippet>Brothers isn't nearly as haunting and singular as "Last Days," because the faux-documentary format too closely mirrors the Behind The Music trajectory of a thousand other rock-band flameouts.</snippet>

         <snippet>Directors Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe (Lost in La Mancha) are too preoccupied with hip cleverness to have much else on their minds, and the music is so-so.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately, Brothers is a flashy, stylistic show of emptiness, intended to protest emptiness. But that's clear almost from the outset.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite the odd moment of visual bravura, this mockumentary is too aware of its own satirical daring. Consequently, it's never as dark, dangerous or amusing as it thinks - and the soundtrack is diabolical.</snippet>

         <snippet>"This Is Spinal Tap" took the mockumentary up to 11. Brothers of the Head brings it back down to about four.</snippet>

         <snippet>A glumly serious British mock rock doc: You could forgive the paucity of jokes if Brothers of the Head had anything to say, or if the '70s-vérité surface were remotely convincing.</snippet>
