         <snippet>Has a sitcom format, but complex emotions and perceptions keep breaking through the surface in an engaging, thoughtful manner.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cavanagh, best known for the TV show "Ed," is terrific--as is young Bernett, who steals the show without hogging it.</snippet>

         <snippet>A crowd-pleasing comedy that makes up for its formulaic, sitcom-ready premise with likable performances and an inviting sense of humor.</snippet>

         <snippet>With witty throwaway bits and Cavanagh's fast delivery, "Scot" gets away with a third-act dip into hearts and platitudes. Otherwise, it's refreshingly snarky and quick.</snippet>

         <snippet>Deserves sympathetic attention, if only for the family-values specifics loaded into the story, and the way mildmannered stars Ben Shenkman (Angels in America) and Tom Cavanagh (Ed) embrace their instructional roles.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is territory previously covered in the French film "Ma Vie en Rose," which took a relatively more sophisticated view of both a child's self-expression and adults' discomfort over it.</snippet>

         <snippet>For its courage to address a ticklish subject with warmhearted humor, Breakfast With Scot, adapted from a novel by Michael Downing, deserves a light round of applause.</snippet>

         <snippet>Why is Breakfast With Scot in theaters instead of set for broadcast on the Lifetime, Hallmark or ABC Family channels?</snippet>

         <snippet>A feel-good tale with undeniably good intentions, this Canadian comedy-drama doesn't really manage to convince on any level.</snippet>

         <snippet>It would be churlish to parse the logic of the underlying situation too closely when all the filmmakers are really after is a heartwarming little object lesson in tolerance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Suffused with the bargain-basement blandness of an Afterschool Special, Breakfast with Scot is the kind of gay-themed pic that won't ruffle the feathers of a granny in Manitoba, though it's bound to make more discerning auds groan.</snippet>
