         <snippet>A true gem: perhaps the most thoroughly charming, and completely satisfying, independent film I've seen in the past two or three years.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's an altogether satisfying drama -- the sort of movie some people complain they don't make anymore. So here it is; what's your excuse?</snippet>

         <snippet>Directed with charming restraint by the acclaimed American producer Dan Ireland, the film is a quiet triumph for Dame Joan.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plowright's performance as a genteel widow in Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont is a small-scale gem, deeply felt without being in the least bit showy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The details are what matters, and thanks to a cast of all-star British elders and a mischievous sense of humor, the filmmakers bring those details to vivid life.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie pulls off the trick of blurring the distinctions between romantic and platonic attractions across the generations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Newcomer Friend, a Leonardo DiCaprio lookalike who can also be seen in small roles in "The Libertine" and "Pride &amp; Prejudice," has a winning manner, but Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont is a terrific, long-overdue vehicle for Lady Olivier.</snippet>

         <snippet>The casting, at least, is magical. Plowright shows both her character's strength and her heartbreaking vulnerability, sometimes at once.</snippet>

         <snippet>Occasionally cloying, but the distinguished British cast (Anna Massey, Robert Lang, Georgina Hale, Millicent Martin) generates considerable gravitas.</snippet>

         <snippet>A low-key drama with comedic undertones that will appeal to older auds, arthouse patrons, and Joan Plowright fans.</snippet>

         <snippet>The unabashedly sentimental film is a juicy morsel for the great British actress Dame Joan Plowright, who endows Mrs. Palfrey with stoic charm and decency.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cast manages some sweet moments, and Plowright lends a touch of grace and wit to each new indignity or kindness. Yet the whole thing feels programmed; the movie's sense of humor lacks understatement.</snippet>

         <snippet>As it is, Mrs. Palfrey seems to suggest the Claremont is located somewhere in the Twilight Zone. Where are the televisions? Where are the chain stores? Where are the immigrants? I see the buildings, but where is England?</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>In its well-mannered way, this genteel film delicately keeps its platonic May-December love story from turning creepy. But without the sexual undertones and macabre humor of Hal Ashby's classic, Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont is merely a soft, slightly patronizing movie about the poignancy of aging.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching these old pros elbow their way into the spotlight is the filmâ€™s finest surprise, but watching Plowright out-act them all is the ultimate joy.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the compelling Plowright competently flexes her well-trained muscle, the film's melodrama too readily evokes a Lifetime Original Movie rather than subtle sentiment.</snippet>
