         <snippet>A furiously choreographed martial-arts spectacle wrapped in a fumbling narrative.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Protector is about 84 minutes long, and only four of those minutes are devoted to plot.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Protector is the nuttiest movie I've seen all year, and I've seen the last 20 minutes of "The Wicker Man."</snippet>

         <snippet>It's silly, at times laughable, sure, but Jaa has a reckless, bone-cracking grace that transcends the film's triviality.</snippet>

         <snippet>But while every expertly choreographed Muy Thai bout delivers, the film suffers from haphazard editing. Entire sequences of explanation are missing, as if Pinkaew made a 2 1/2 hour martial-arts film and then cut everything but the fighting scenes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Delivers a steady stream of cheap B-movie thrills, plus two positive messages for young people: Be nice to animals, and when in doubt, always aim for the tendons.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the story's silly, the stunts, choreographed by Jaa and popular Thai filmmaker Panna Rittikrai, are spectacular.</snippet>

         <snippet>Boasting the same refreshing avoidance of CGI and wire work as "Warrior," slickly made production (largely by the same team) is more consciously aimed at the international market, with its Australian setting and multilingual dialogue.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jaa has the skills for the job, and shows them off in numerous fight scenes; it's just a shame that the movie he's in is barely acceptable in any other respect.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lives up to Tarantino's imprimatur, both in its cheesy grind house aesthetic and its occasional forays into brilliant, bravura filmmaking.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is basically a love story between a man and his elephant, and if viewed as such, it's not nearly as ridiculous as the movie it first appears to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sadly, the greatness of Jaa's movements are drowned by an ocean of bad editing, terrible dubbing, disorienting action sequences, and repetitive fight sequences that feel as if they were copied straight from a side-scrolling videogame like "Streets of Rage."</snippet>

         <snippet>This ludicrous Quentin Tarantino-chosen low-budget movie features choppy editing and an amateurish script, and it switches strangely back and forth between dubbing and subtitles.</snippet>
