         <snippet>Very different than "Kids." Where the earlier film was exhausting in its nihilism, the latest retains a good-natured charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>You could think of Larry Clark's Wassup Rockers as "Ferris Velasquez's Day Off."</snippet>

         <snippet>Somehow, this rollicking day in the life of a band of skateboarding Latino punk-rockers doesn't exude the voyeuristic smarm of previous Clark forays.</snippet>

         <snippet>Throughout the film, music is used to define character and place. Two metal bands, Moral Decay and South Central Riot Squad, dominate the soundtrack whenever the gang is on the move.</snippet>

         <snippet>A thoroughly winning and unexpectedly observant lark about the antics of seven Latino skateboarding pals in South-Central Los Angeles.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shifting his focus away from white kids seems to have done Clark good, because Wassup Rockers is the least sensationalistic, and hence the least moralistic, of his films. It's an enjoyable if haphazard picaresque.</snippet>

         <snippet>If "Crash" grew a pair of cojones, it might look something like Larry Clark’s cheerfully defiant Wassup Rockers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Could have been a spiky culture clash. When it tries to shock us with its alleged realism, though, it is entirely a bore.</snippet>

         <snippet>The main characters may be refreshingly cliché-free, but almost everyone they meet in Beverly Hills is a stilted cartoon.</snippet>

         <snippet>What might have been a fascinating, intimate portrait turns into something much less compelling when Clark tries to impose a sex-and-action-packed narrative on the proceedings.</snippet>

         <snippet>At a certain point, Wassup Rockers transforms from a relatively naturalistic slice-of-life portrait into a surrealistic funhouse trap.</snippet>

         <snippet>However you respond to Wassup Rockers, it is completely alive, unlike any number of teenage Hollywood movies with their stale formulas and second-hand puerility. And that's mostly to the good.</snippet>

         <snippet>The sexy, scruffy, neo-Warriors pageantry of ghetto teen hunger would have been a lot more vital if Clark didn't have such a class-war chip on his shoulder.</snippet>

         <snippet>It may be truer to the lives of his amateur cast to watch them engage in mumbly, inarticulate conversations between rounds of failed skate tricks, but it isn't especially cinematic.</snippet>

         <snippet>The stilted performances are especially unfortunate when one considers what a fine documentary Clark might have gotten out of the same material.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately more laughable than illuminating, at times approaching a level of camp commensurate with John Waters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wassup Rockers is amateurish, but without the redeeming qualities found in "Kids" and "Bully."</snippet>

         <snippet>In drama, tone, character and examination of the social issues tormenting these kids, Wassup Rockers is . . . taxing.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a filmmaker, Clark still seems more beholden to his roots as a still photographer: Images are sometimes worth a thousand words, but, ultimately, they will always be skin-deep.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's hard to believe this shoddy, dishonest mess is Clark's sixth feature film, and not the unpromising debut of a rank amateur.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a well-intentioned mess -- a dishonest fantasy that begins with promise and gets more frustrating with every scene.</snippet>
