         <snippet>This consistently gripping, visually intoxicating film stands as a landmark of contemporary Turkish cinema.</snippet>

         <snippet>Self-discovery always comes with a cost, and in Bliss the price is a great one. It is mesmerizing to watch it unfold in the lives of these two young people.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just as key to the movie's impact are its well-acted scenes of heart-wrenching emotion, although some stray perilously close to melodrama.</snippet>

         <snippet>To its favor, the film is blessed with strong peformances by Ozgu Namal as Meryem and Murat Han as Cemal.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though calling out the abominable oppression of women, even in a vehicle as didactic as Bliss, serves at least some redeemable purpose.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Abdullah Oguz gives us lots of nice scenery, but the simplistic story and characters strain credibility. What's more, the climactic plot turn is as hokey as it gets.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is infotainment dressed up as an art flick. Turkish society is fascinatingly complex and its East/West tensions give rise not to easy allegories but to hard ambiguities. To explore that truth, read any novel by Orhan Pamuk. To escape it, watch Bliss.</snippet>
