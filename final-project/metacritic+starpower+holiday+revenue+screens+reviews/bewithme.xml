         <snippet>A delicately crafted, gently inflected, lovely little movie about the need for love, directed and co-written by Singapore's Eric Khoo ("Mee Pok Man").</snippet>

         <snippet>It might take a while to figure out what is happening, because Khoo provides no expository dialogue. But viewers' patience will be rewarded as the stories come together in a moving fashion.</snippet>

         <snippet>Singaporean writer-director Eric Khoo's third feature is a beautiful, contemplative study of love -- unrequited, unfulfilled and reborn.</snippet>

         <snippet>The fact that her story of triumph over unimaginable odds doesn't come freighted with mystical and religious bromides makes it all the more inspiring.</snippet>

         <snippet>This elliptical, poetic movie is filled with yearning, humor, and warmth.</snippet>

         <snippet>One terrific love story sandwiched between two mundane ones in this three-part look at love.</snippet>

         <snippet>A curate's egg of a movie that starts intriguingly but becomes increasingly frustrating.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sometimes clumsy and dry, always sympathetic, and wryly interested in the impact food has on social intercourse, Be With Me is eventually affecting once its elliptical shape becomes clear.</snippet>
