         <snippet>Ginnifer Goodwin gives a standout performance--and thatâ€™s saying a lot considering the large cast--as the insecure, neurotic female looking for love.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never soars, but it never flags. It remains brisk, engaging and pleasant throughout, and face it: If a movie this well made had Spanish or French subtitles, we'd all be talking about it as a searing examination of sexual politics.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie has a few too many story threads, but it also has some very funny lines and offers sharp-eyed commentary on the state of relationships in the era of instant messages and MySpace.</snippet>

         <snippet>With an all-star cast maintaining an amiable tone throughout, the result is a movie in which everyone should see themselves for at least a few minutes (and wish they were that young, that beautiful and that well-off).</snippet>

         <snippet>While "Love, Actually" succeeded in providing well-developed characters in (mostly) interesting situations, He's Just Not That Into You is often flat with subplots that feel rushed and/or contrived.</snippet>

         <snippet>Good comfort food for most of its running time, thanks to a cast of attractive, unchallenging pros and Ken Kwapis's smooth direction.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is Woody Allen lite, with some deft observations about how the social media designed to bring singles together are actually coming between them.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a bit like a weightless swirl of cotton candy with a mere second of sweetness before it dissolves on your tongue. But then there's nothing wrong with cotton candy, and besides, the filmmakers never promised more. I guess they're just not into that.</snippet>

         <snippet>He's Just Not That Into You turns romantic sanity into something so sanitized that it starts to make delusion look good.</snippet>

         <snippet>I suppose it's a good thing that this movie has so many crisscrossing subplots. If one gaggle of whiners gets on your nerves, rest assured the scenery will soon change and another will take center stage.</snippet>

         <snippet>I think the movie intends to empower all of its female characters, but it ends up chaining them to stale, timeworn ideas.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like the recent "Sex and the City" movie, this spinoff not so subtly tries to have its cake and eat it by ALSO suggesting that a woman is nothing without a man.</snippet>

         <snippet>If all you ask for is a few gay jokes, a perky score, pretty shots of Baltimore, and some clever but callow observations of sexual mores in the city, He's Just Not That Into You is an amiable enough night out.</snippet>

         <snippet>All of this results in way too much relationship chatter and not nearly enough comedy, romance or even dysfunctional relationships. We want to laugh -- but at what?</snippet>

         <snippet>No one has anything to distract them from the minutiae of their love lives, which they proceed to incinerate through overanalysis. It's a moral fable, maybe, if you make half a million a year.</snippet>

         <snippet>After more than two hours, what we're left with feels like a Robert Altman movie on Botox. It has some real substance and heft, but it also might be a bit too glossy.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's tons of professionalism in He's Just Not That Into You, but it lacks passion -- they should have called it "Like, Actually."</snippet>

         <snippet>Yes, that's an impressive collection of actors. And yes, it's deflating to watch them wandering in and out of half-written scenes with no discernable direction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Some of the players comport themselves better than others--Barrymore is sweetly wistful in her minor role, while Johansson, as a confident go-getter who sets out to steal her crush object rather than moon over him, is sexier than the whole cast put together.</snippet>

         <snippet>Scratch the surface, and the movie's underpinnings are an insult to women everywhere -- the film is slick stupid propaganda for the myth of The One True Love that wastes the talents of fine actresses.</snippet>
