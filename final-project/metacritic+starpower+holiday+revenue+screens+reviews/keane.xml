         <snippet>Keane is a painfully specific figure but at the same time a totem, lean and frightening, for a morass of modern anxieties. That might be this phenomenal film's emergent achievement: Its raw hopelessness is its universality.</snippet>

         <snippet>This isn't entertainment in any conventional sense, but it's a mesmerizing film all the same.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lodge Kerrigan is one of the great, though largely unheralded, filmmakers of our time, and with Keane, his third feature, he finally shows himself to be in full command of his uncompromising talent.</snippet>

         <snippet>Keane is played by Damian Lewis.  Here he inhabits an edge of madness that Lodge Kerrigan understands with a fierce sympathy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie draws us into complicity with someone who may be on the verge of insanity, but only because he's living with the unbearable.</snippet>

         <snippet>British actor Damian Lewis, in an astonishingly elastic yet disciplined performance, invests Keane with a richly ambiguous, heartbreaking inner life that's only at peace when he manages to form a tenuous human connection.</snippet>

         <snippet>Keane is a movie you might see on a dare, and though I think it is brilliantly conceived, I wouldn't dare to dare you.</snippet>

         <snippet>The first 10 minutes of Lodge Kerrigan's Keane have a raw, hurtling reality that's as painfully engrossing as anything you'll see in a recent non-fiction movie, a searing portrait of one man's hell, from inside and outside.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lewis, from the TV series "Band of Brothers," gives a super performance, but the revelation here is young Breslin, who was in Garry Marshall's "Raising Helen" and M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs."</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Kerrigan isn't just playing with our sympathies; he's also playing with our assumptions. That keeps the tension going.</snippet>

         <snippet>Throughout Keane, there's an unnerving feeling that Lewis is capable of anything, from harming himself to assaulting anyone around him.</snippet>
