         <snippet>This delicious little period piece from Spanish writer-director Pablo Berger is like one of those really expensive chocolates, where you start out expecting a brief sugar buzz and end up surprised by the sophistication and delicacy of the flavor.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a bawdy farce done with real delicacy, a charming adult comedy that ends up with unlooked-for emotional heft. If that doesn't cover all the bases, it certainly comes close.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a highly amusing folly, rendered with a surprisingly gentle affection.</snippet>

         <snippet>Such a joyous celebration of sex and filmmaking that viewers will forgive its director for taking time out to enjoy a little of both.</snippet>

         <snippet>Raunchy without ever devolving into flat-out prurience, Berger's oddly sweet comedy perfectly captures the naivete of the era and the unexpected wholesomeness of some of its adult entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though never unpleasant, thanks largely to Cámara and Peña's warmly convincing performances, Torremolinos 73 only really takes off when it deals with the filmmaking process.</snippet>

         <snippet>Starting out as a wacky little comedy about a mousy Spanish couple who become unwitting porn stars, Torremolinos 73 suddenly morphs, during the third act, into a far more sober and tender story about the lengths to which a man will go to give his wife what she wants.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>This is a gentle, camp but nonetheless revealing satire on how a nation circumvented the social strictures imposed upon it by Franco's fading fascist regime.</snippet>

         <snippet>Somewhat wacky tale, based on real events, is kept anchored in reality through attention to detail and by first-rate central perfs.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Its Saul Bass-y credits suggest an Almodóvarian flamboyance, but this impotent '70s-set comedy mostly skimps on discoteca stylishness.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Has the dubious distinction of being just about the mildest porno comedy ever made. It's like something the teenage Pedro Almodóvar might have written to shock his 10th-grade creative writing teacher.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pablo Berger's subtle satire Torremolinos 73 is almost there. Almost.</snippet>

         <snippet>All this and not a glimmer of General Franco makes for a surreal – and sporadically inspired – comedy of Spanish mores back when naughty was nice.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Has the slapped-together, cheesy look of a porno movie. While this could be distracting, the shoddiness sets the mood for a humorous spin on the European porn industry circa early 1970s.</snippet>

         <snippet>Camara and Peña are perfectly cast as the bewildered couple, and early on Berger gets some laughs from the one-note premise. But the material grows increasingly stale as the film drags on to its unintentionally creepy finale.</snippet>
