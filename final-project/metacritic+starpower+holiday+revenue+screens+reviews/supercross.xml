         <snippet>Like the drive-in classics of Roger Corman and Samuel Z. Arkoff, this develops the principal characters and conflicts with just enough depth and keeps the narrative moving at a brisk pace.</snippet>

         <snippet>Amusingly, Supercross puts up a fierce anticorporate front, lauding the self-financed ''privateer'' over the ''factory'' cyclist. If this is a joke, few will get it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Filled with tremendous stunts and well-shot racing sequences, director Steve Boyum's loud, down-and-dirty ride through the world of Supercross motorcycle racing comes to a screeching halt for its many pit stops for Hollywood clich√©s.</snippet>

         <snippet>Provides plenty of authentic dirt-flying motorcycle thrills, but the film's excruciating earnestness and clunky script frequently slow its energetic pace to a grinding halt.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately, Supercross is an example of how too much of anything will get annoying -- including VVRRRROOOOOOOMMM and flying bikes.</snippet>

         <snippet>When huge chunks of character development and narrative exposition are relegated to a track announcer's running commentary, it can never be a good sign.</snippet>

         <snippet>For anyone who digs hardcore motorcycle racing, Supercross delivers enough engine-revving, dirt-spewing motorcross action to satisfy even the most intense adrenaline craving.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, while director Steve Boyum is a successful stunt man and off-road biker, his skills do not extend to the relatively passive arena of filmmaking. Somehow, he even makes much of the action static.</snippet>

         <snippet>While there's no blood to be seen in Supercross, the film is rated PG- 13, due to some crash scenes, a little strong language and some mild sexuality. That's a shame. This movie was tailor-made for 12-year-olds.</snippet>

         <snippet>The most amazing fact about Supercross is that it took three people to write it. Two chimpanzees with a typewriter could have done just as good a job.</snippet>

         <snippet>Since the focus is on the track, the filmmakers aren't out to reinvent the wheel, but for such a simple piece of formula storytelling, they do a remarkably poor job of dotting I's and crossing T's.</snippet>
