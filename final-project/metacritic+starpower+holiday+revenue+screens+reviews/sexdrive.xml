         <snippet>Sex Drive has shaky moments, and its smutty gags aren't edited so much as slammed together.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sex Drive's first 30 minutes may lead one to suspect there's nothing new to be seen here, but it undergoes a transformation once the preliminaries have been dispensed with. John Hughes would be pleased - and so also might Judd Apatow.</snippet>

         <snippet>Seth Green is uproarious as an Amish farmer who speaks in sentences so passive-aggressive, they're like tiny slaps.</snippet>

         <snippet>A testosterone-fueled road movie that displays the same Apatow-ian obsessions, and raunch, as "Pineapple Express," "Superbad," and "The 40-Year-Old Virgin."</snippet>

         <snippet>Three things and three things only keep Sex Drive from being teen-comedy landfill. The first is James Marsden, hilarious as the hero's bully-boy big brother. The second is Seth Green, beyond droll as an Amishman with attitude. The third is the Mexican doughnut costume.</snippet>

         <snippet>The gags are as idiotic as you'd expect, but they consistently hit the bull's-eye.</snippet>

         <snippet>Okay, it doesn’t have an original bone in its body, but forgetting the awful title, Sex Drive has its share of snappy lines and decent gags. It’s also got Seth Green and James Marsden on cracking form, which should never be underestimated.</snippet>

         <snippet>The first half-hour of this movie is super-worse, with only some sub-"American Pie" gags fleshing out the lame-brain plot, but once it gets on the road, there's pleasure to be had.</snippet>

         <snippet>The sweetheart leads, Josh Zuckerman and Amanda Crew, are easy to spend time with, and Seth Green as an Amish hipster and Clark Duke as an unlikely lady-killer hit every sweet-and-sardonic note with panache.</snippet>

         <snippet>Some jokes work, some don't and, frankly, I can't remember either, but it leaves a sweet aftertaste. Slight, but sweet.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is pulled along mostly by James Marsden's cheerfully over-the-top performance as Ian's homophobic older brother, but Josh Zuckerman does a nice job of keeping Ian likable.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not "Sixteen Candles," but it's not "Road Trip," either. Instead, this comedic car-trip riff on the teen-male libido and the lengths to which it will go to satisfy itself falls somewhere in between part endearing emo love story, part gross-out semen gag-fest, and, very occasionally, a smart, inspired, non-sequitur-laden hoot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Less sex comedy and more Seth comedy would have made for a much livelier excursion.</snippet>

         <snippet>Since the new pic contains little that's genuinely amusing or minimally original, it likely will fail on its own merits.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just slightly funnier than you'd expect, this dashed-off teen comedy cribs from a thousand other movies, without coming up with anything original of its own.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sean Anders' derivative gross-out movie Sex Drive is easier to take  if you accept that the answer to every baffling plot question is "because it’s a teen sex comedy."</snippet>
