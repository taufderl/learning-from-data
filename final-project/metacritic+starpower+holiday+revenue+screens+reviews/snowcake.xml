         <snippet>Most noteworthy for the performance of Sigourney Weaver as Linda, an autistic woman.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman imbue screenwriter Angela Pell's characters with a quiet authenticity that's surprisingly moving.</snippet>

         <snippet>Modest but well wrought and witty, Snow Cake is full of unexpected moments and clever observations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Does sidle up to the brink of mawkishness, but it pulls back so nicely into Weaver's rich, hard-headed evocation of Linda's limitations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rickman and Weaver sell it, and the utterly heart wrenching finale is the big pay off, and the experience is worth it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Snow Cake is dazlious, too: overly forced, a shade too whimsical, but filling a void other words and other movies haven't the nerve or errant taste to confront.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, Weaver provides a moving and sensitive portrait of one person out of an estimated 400,000 in America with this mental disorder we are just beginning to understand.</snippet>

         <snippet>If only Snow Cake had hewed closer to this idea of showing what an adult autist's life and experiences are like, rather than getting caught up in Rickman's rote re-awakening, it could've been as powerful as it strains to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>The mental and physical landscape would do justice to an Atom Egoyan film, but in this film, the key dramatic moments feel as forced as they are predictable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Boosted by a delish performance from Carrie-Anne Moss as a local vamp who helps unthaw the Englishman, but holed beneath the waterline by a gratingly miscast Sigourney Weaver as the persnickety autistic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like "I Am Sam," it is a film that tests your cynicism.</snippet>

         <snippet>An awfully tidy, infernally sparkly study in skewed blessings, made manifest by Committed Acting from Sigourney Weaver.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never gets as emotionally involving, or persuasive, as the moviemakers intend it to.</snippet>

         <snippet>The picture is so drab and listless that it often feels like punishment, even though Rickman gives a fine performance, one that's heartfelt as well as characteristically elegant (not to mention sexy).</snippet>
