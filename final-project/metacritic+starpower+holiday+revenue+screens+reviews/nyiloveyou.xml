         <snippet>Oddly, the filmmaker best known for his Valentines to New York, Woody Allen, is not participant.</snippet>

         <snippet>These tales are as highly designed as fashion layouts. But they're as relaxing to thumb through as those NYT Magazine trend pieces.</snippet>

         <snippet>Look at the cast and credits to form an idea of the directors and actors at work here. By its nature, New York, I Love You can't add up. It remains the sum of its parts. If one isn't working for you, wait a few minutes, here comes another one. New Yorkers, I love you.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gamely tries to capture a vast, twinkling cityscape with not one love story - but 11 little ones, a few of them overlapping.</snippet>

         <snippet>All of the participating directors – save Balsmeyer and actor Natalie Portman – are known for features. So part of the interest is seeing how the short form puts their strengths, weaknesses, thematic interests or styles into sharp focus.</snippet>

         <snippet>Provides some compensatory satisfactions, thanks mostly to the actors, as they make the most of a series of pencil sketches.</snippet>

         <snippet>Neither a comprehensive guide nor consistently good, but because the theme is romance, most of these small bites of the Big Apple are easy to digest.</snippet>

         <snippet>Where "Paris" was the ingénue, fresh-faced and surprising, "New York" needed to come in with the confidence of a more practiced hand, and it never quite manages that. Better to think of it as a day trip rather than an actual film, just a brief, mostly delightful excursion into the city.</snippet>

         <snippet>New York, I Love You wants us to know that the city is a sexy, romantic, thrillingly random place where anything can go down. Sadly, two of those things are your eyelids.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result, as is always the case with short story collections, is a mixed bag, although unlike "Paris Je T'Aime," the duds outnumber the winners this time.</snippet>

         <snippet>The segments don’t form anything like a coherent whole, but they aren’t distinctive enough to clash meaningfully with each other, either.</snippet>

         <snippet>Doesn't evoke New York and its vignettes are trite – with one exception, a touching sequence directed by Mira Nair with Natalie Portman as a Hasidic bride and Irrfan Khan as a Jain diamond merchant.</snippet>

         <snippet>The pieces of New York, I Love You make up a parallel city that no one would want to live in, much less visit.</snippet>

         <snippet>Anyone who actually adores New York is unlikely to appreciate this disappointingly bland collection of shorts, which might as well have been called "Madrid, Te Amo" or "Cincinnati, You're the Best."</snippet>

         <snippet>Cutesy and generic, New York, I Love You is almost colossally inept at capturing five-boroughs flavor.</snippet>

         <snippet>The results are, well, formulaic, hobbled by weak dialogue and absent any sense of texture.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite Benhiby's best efforts to create one from many, the only thing the roughly 10-minute segments in New York, I Love You have in common are a general air of indifference.</snippet>

         <snippet>When New York, I Love You was previewed in Toronto a year ago, there were two additional segments that have since been cut. So you'll have to wait for the DVD to see just how bad Scarlett Johansson's directing debut is.</snippet>
