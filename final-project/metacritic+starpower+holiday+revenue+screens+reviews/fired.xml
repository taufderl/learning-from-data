         <snippet>Just when the film seems to be getting bogged down in "before I made it big" anecdotes -- around the time she and Andy Dick, who was once dismissed from a food-service gig, spend a day operating a mobile lunch stand -- Gurwitch wisely broadens her focus, interviewing ordinary victims of corporate "right-sizing," plant closings.</snippet>

         <snippet>A pleasant, leisurely 71 minutes, frequently beguiling thanks to Gurwitch's soft-sell version of the urbane, Second City-esque female noodge.</snippet>

         <snippet>While unlikely to set the documentary market afire, is entertaining enough.</snippet>

         <snippet>Modestly amusing in fits and starts, Fired! proves most potent when on-screen interviewees are playing for keeps, not for laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>While "maybe it's for the best" proved happily prophetic for her actor pals, those words of comfort sound more like a clueless bromide when you consider the 30,000 people laid off in Lansing after the film wrapped.</snippet>

         <snippet>Having written a book about being fired, Annabelle Gurwitch has now made a documentary as well, and it's something of a mess.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fired! is missing the one thing it could have used most: a career objective.</snippet>

         <snippet>At one point, David Cross tells Gurwitch to enjoy being unemployed, because "When you're fired, you're interesting." But as Fired! proves, that ain't necessarily so.</snippet>

         <snippet>The video is heavy on actors and other showbiz types, and the self-centered Gurwitch doesn't distinguish between a factory worker laid off after decades on the job and an actor getting rejected during tryouts.</snippet>

         <snippet>Feels like a desperate attempt to stretch a flimsy half-hour made-for-cable concept into a feature film.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a shame Allen fired her from that play. After all, then she might not have had the time to make this documentary.</snippet>
