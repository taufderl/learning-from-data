         <snippet>It's a movie of such jaw-dropping violence, wild improbability and dazzling style it overpowers all resistance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Oldboy is a powerful film not because of what it depicts, but because of the depths of the human heart which it strips bare.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a work of art for sure, but a sadistic one. Oldboy is one of the year's best; it just isn't for everyone. If you're still interested, go for it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whatever its oversteps and excesses (I do think Park ran a little amok with the computer gimcrackery), Oldboy has the bulldozing nerve and full-blooded passion of a classic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once the picture gets into Hollywood's bloodstream, it could well prove to be as influential as John Woo's 1989 crime thriller, "The Killer."</snippet>

         <snippet>This hunt for revenge is really a quest for self-discovery. The story, acting and brilliant directing elevate Oldboy into a human struggle to know yourself and your place in the universe, and to live with that sometimes terrible knowledge.</snippet>

         <snippet>Obviously, this sort of taboo-flouting imagery isn't for everyone, but Park's vision is all of a piece.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is absolutely not a film for all tastes, but it's a masterpiece of pitiless power whose audacious, ambiguous climax strikes a note of insane romanticism as haunting as it is perverse.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a powerfully visceral experience that justifies itself almost entirely on surface chops, with striking color composition and a complex sound design that elevates the story to an operatic scale.</snippet>

         <snippet>You will surely leave this movie shocked, shaken and surprisingly moved. And definitely stuck on that poor octopus.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its magnificence is that it takes itself dead serious. It's not entertainment, but it's sure a piece of toughness.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the climax is admittedly something of a letdown after all the build-up, it's a hopelessly, helplessly original film, all guts, no glory.</snippet>

         <snippet>More than anything else, Oldboy recalls Alfred Hitchcock with all restraint tossed to the wind, or Hitchcock's most obsessed devotee, Brian De Palma, at his most nastily inspired.</snippet>

         <snippet>It says something when you come out of a film as weird and fantastical as Oldboy and feel that you've experienced something truly authentic. I just don't know what. I can't think of anything to compare it to.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's just the kind of film that you'd expect a jury led by Quentin Tarantino to choose, a bloody and brutal revenge film immersed in madness and directed with operatic intensity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Oldboy has the fatal air of wanting so desperately to be a cult movie that it forgets to present itself as a coherent one.</snippet>

         <snippet>Oldboy caused a love-it-or-hate-it stir at Cannes last year, and how could it not: It's an onslaught made to cause a sensation. Consider me simultaneously jolted and depressed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Entertaining to watch - notwithstanding the scene in which Dae-su eats a live animal - which is a good thing, because there is not much to think about here, outside of the choreographed mayhem.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite its director's skill at staging trash with dash, Oldboy is too long and portentous to be an enjoyable B movie. The movie's self-seriousness short-circuits its sensationalism.</snippet>
