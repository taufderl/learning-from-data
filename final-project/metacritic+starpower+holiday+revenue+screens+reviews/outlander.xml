         <snippet>It's entertaining nonsense with major league special effects, larger-than-life characters and inventive monsters that draw on the "Aliens" and "Predator" models, being terrifying but also vaguely sympathetic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Surprise number one: It's smarter than it looks. Surprise number two: That doesn't entirely ruin it as an action film.</snippet>

         <snippet>An enjoyably goofy hybrid of extraterrestrial sci-fi and Iron Age action, Outlander boasts a super-serious Jim Caviezel in the title role</snippet>

         <snippet>If only Outlander was as fun as the premise makes it sound on paper.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not helped by a wooden perf from Jim Caviezel as a humanoid alien who accidentally imports a real alien to eighth-century Earth.</snippet>

         <snippet>Outlander is interesting as a collision of genres: the monster movie meets the Viking saga. You have to give it credit for carrying that premise to its ultimate (if not logical) conclusion.</snippet>

         <snippet>By taking nonsense seriously Outlander never achieves camp. It's a comic book that's mistaken itself for scripture.</snippet>

         <snippet>There isn't a single scene in this story about a traveler from another planet (Jim Caviezel) who crash-lands on Earth during the Iron Age that doesn't remind you of another, better movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>In its second half, Outlander falls apart completely, becoming nothing but a violent, mindless monster movie along the lines of "Alien vs. Predator."</snippet>

         <snippet>Writer-director Howard McCain bids fair to dethrone Uwe Boll as the king of crap action flicks, and every second feels like time on the cross.</snippet>
