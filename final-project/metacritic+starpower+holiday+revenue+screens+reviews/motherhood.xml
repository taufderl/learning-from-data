         <snippet>Neither earth-shaking nor profound, but it has considerable charm, thanks to an appealing cast and some sharply witty observations about the pressures of child-rearing in Manhattan.</snippet>

         <snippet>Parenthood seems only half aware of Eliza's REAL problem: that she thinks she's superior to the choices she's made.</snippet>

         <snippet>Uma Thurman looks frumpy in Motherhood. This is the only pressing reason to see it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's narrative tension hinges on, well, nothing.</snippet>

         <snippet>When it aims for humor, it feels overwrought and clichéd.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dieckmann nails the look of a certain niche of urban neo-middle-class living, but the film's hyper-earnest tone and reliance on "day-from-hell" New York clichés overwhelm those details.</snippet>

         <snippet>Motherhood doesn't really need a recession to call attention to its flaws. The movie's a perfect dud on its own terms.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Carrie Bradshaw ever trades her Manolos for sneakers and starts blogging about raising children, I pray she wouldn't be as tiresome as the heroine of Katherine Dieckmann's insufferable comedy Motherhood.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dieckmann fails to notice that Thurman doesn’t have the comic chops for the material--she comes off more like a self-pitying loser than a witty, put-upon everywoman.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thurman is bespectacled again for Motherhood, and it saddens me to report that neither she nor this comedy turns into more than an argument against procreation.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s a judgmental tale whose only payoff is carpe diem drivel.</snippet>

         <snippet>Motherhood's litany of complaints and trite comedy-drama comes off as thin, and targeted, as a flyer for The Children's Place.</snippet>
