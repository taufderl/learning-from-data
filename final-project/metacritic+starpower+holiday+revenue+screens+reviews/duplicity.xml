         <snippet>Superior entertainment, the most elegantly pleasurable movie of its kind to come around in a very long time.</snippet>

         <snippet>An enormously enjoyable hybrid, a romantic comedy set at the center of a caper movie. But the froth arrives with steel bubbles--the tone is amused and mordantly satirical.</snippet>

         <snippet>Smart, droll and dazzling to look at and listen to, writer-director Tony Gilroy's effervescent, intricately plotted puzzler proves in every way superior to his 2007 success "Michael Clayton."</snippet>

         <snippet>Comedy seems to have liberated Gilroy, who directs Duplicity with the high gloss and fleet-footed hustle of a golden-age Hollywood craftsman.</snippet>

         <snippet>A throwback to the days of old-school caper movies like "To Catch a Thief," Duplicity is just the kind of sophisticated amusement you would expect from filmmaker Tony Gilroy.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's smart, it's for grown-ups and it lets Julia Roberts laugh, if just once.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a role that the Julia Roberts of 1999 couldn't have played, and that's fine. The one we have here is much better.</snippet>

         <snippet>Duplicity so thoroughly equates sex and money that, in a manner apt for a recession, the audience is rewired when it's over. You don't care whether they love each other. You just want to see them paid.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie resembles Mad magazine's "Spy vs. Spy" series, elevated to labyrinthine levels of complexity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Duplicity is perfectly titled: There isn't a second of this smart, twisty, grown-up thriller in which someone isn't lying, cheating or stealing, often from someone they claim to love.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tony Gilroy deserves the lion's share of credit for making such a delightful movie. His writing and direction find the perfect balance of comedy, sexiness, and tension.</snippet>

         <snippet>So this is a light/bright movie that actually illuminates our dull grey lives, reminding us that intrigue can be, well, intriguing. And damn sexy too.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are so many leaps back and forth in time, so many twists and countertwists and double fake-outs, that we keep losing track of who (including ourselves) is supposed to know what when.</snippet>

         <snippet>Duplicity zips from one elaborate piece of hugger-mugger to the next. But at a certain point (for me, it was Rome), boredom sets in.</snippet>

         <snippet>On the plus side, if you're flummoxed by the twisty plot or its occasional holes, you can always gaze contentedly at Clive Owen and be wholly entertained.</snippet>

         <snippet>Given the assault of devilishly clever plot twists that buzz-bomb your brain like a two-hour binge of quad-shot lattes, Duplicity goes down as too smart for its own good.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even the great cast didnâ€™t make following the convoluted plot any easier. And all that jumping around makes the film feel a lot longer than it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Duplicity is deeply shallow--cheap reversals all the way down. But it's a passably amusing brainteaser.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The chemical combustion just isn't there between Julia and Clive, and you can't help wondering if Gilroy wrote this with George Clooney in mind. Still, a glamorous, diverting escapade that over-30s in particular can enjoy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The female lead in Duplicity calls for the kind of atomic, glow-in-the-dark, Rita Hayworth-in-Gilda sexuality that is most assuredly out of Roberts' range. Angelina Jolie effortlessly conjures up that kind of fire-breathing sexiness. Roberts? Not so much.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all the glam and swank, the film is essentially a bright, shiny, empty puzzle. The puzzlemaking by writer-director Tony Gilroy is clever but most frequently an end in itself.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its one-liners and welter of double-crosses, it should settle on the video shelf between "Intolerable Cruelty" and "Mr &amp; Mrs. Smith."</snippet>

         <snippet>Gilroy zings the film with tantalizing bits of absurdity (one wonders, wistfully, what the Coen brothers would have done with this material), but too often he returns to his darker, more ponderous instincts.</snippet>
