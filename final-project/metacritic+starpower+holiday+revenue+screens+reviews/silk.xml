         <snippet>As sensuous as its title, Silk is an exquisitely felt love story that unfolds as delicately as a blooming flower. And as slowly.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sensual but profoundly silly, Silk is ultimately little more than softcore porn with arthouse trappings, a moony, dopily romantic "Red Shoe Diaries" variation for the NPR set.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though elegantly staged, Silk is badly written and indifferently cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cinematographer Alain Dostie's stunning, painterly cinematography is the best -- and perhaps only -- reason to endure this stunted epic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everything is brought together at the end in a flash of revelation that is spectacularly underwhelming.</snippet>

         <snippet>Failing to make a lick of rational sense, Silk grasps at poetic straws.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the film aspires to the epic with pretensions of deeper philosophical meaning, it ultimately settles for being the "Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" of historical romances.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wan, generically pretty adaptation of Alessandro Baricco's 1996 novel.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Pitt is a reasonably photogenic specimen. But this actor, whose typical screen character is a broken, androgynous man-child, is disastrously miscast.</snippet>

         <snippet>By the end of Francois Gerard's plodding, uninvolving melodrama, his boredom will have nothing on yours.</snippet>

         <snippet>By any standards, Silk is a bad movie: pretentious, stillborn, devoid of emotion.</snippet>

         <snippet>Silk is a snooze. Vacuous, arid and terminally dull, this adaptation of Alessandro Baricco's freak bestseller hasn't a trace of real life or energy to it, and is hamstrung by a lethargic lead performance by Michael Pitt.</snippet>

         <snippet>Silk isn’t just bad. It’s utterly mad. It stutters and hiccups from scene to scene, from country to country, but never once does it make narrative or emotional sense.</snippet>
