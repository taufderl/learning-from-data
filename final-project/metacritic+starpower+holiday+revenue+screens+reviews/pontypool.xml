         <snippet>Think of this witty, economically gory little tour de force as "28 Days Later" written by linguist Noam Chomsky.</snippet>

         <snippet>Primarily though, the film works as a tour de force for McHattie--a veteran character actor making the most of his characterâ€™s long, fluid monologues--and as a sly commentary on journalistic responsibility.</snippet>

         <snippet>Between its ridiculous setup and its hard-to-care-about ending, McDonald still manages to craft an engaging suspense film that -- when you're not scratching your head in puzzlement -- will have you on the edge of your seat.</snippet>

         <snippet>A horror flick that's all talk and (almost) no action? The risk pays off better than you'd think.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pontypool doesn't jell--its pretensions way exceed its reach--yet it's madly suggestive, and it rekindled my affection for the genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>A small Canadian horror film that makes the most of its minuscule budget.</snippet>

         <snippet>The premise has potential, but there's no follow- through. And there's no actual zombie mayhem; we learn everything secondhand -- from phone calls to the station.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a film about the perils of too much talk, there's quite a lot of babbling presented as profundity. The political statements in Pontypool, much like those in another recent Canadian offering, Atom Egoyan's trite terrorism hand-wringer "Adoration," seem all the less provocative for appearing several years too late--McDonald's film might have had more punch if it were released when Bluetooth first rolled out.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pontypool is something like a claustrophobic, locked-in-the-barn zombie movie, only almost without zombies.</snippet>
