         <snippet>''Documentary'' is too impersonal a word and ''visual poem'' is too mushy a phrase to describe Of Time and the City, a short, beautiful, characteristically sublime memory piece by the great British auteur Terence Davies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Most of all, Davies proves himself to be a poet of the commonplace whose art is the exalting of the everyday. He may rail against "the British genius for creating the dismal," but his own work is anything but.</snippet>

         <snippet>Poetically composed, with marvelous lumps of wit and perspective, Of Times and The City is a masterwork.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is a deeply personal piece of art that never descends into the confessional or the therapeutic, and a work of social and literary criticism that never lectures or hectors, but rather, with melancholy, tenderness and wit, manages to sing.</snippet>

         <snippet>A caustic, witty, regretful elegy for a place so transformed that it's virtually unrecognizable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is made up chiefly of found footage and therefore lacks the mise en scene of its predecessors, but it has the added benefit of Davies's voice-over narration, which, thanks to his training and experience as an actor, is enormously powerful.</snippet>

         <snippet>Result is by turns moving, droll and charming, and niftily assembled, but not necessarily that profound.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a warm and extremely thoughtful journey, with a deliberately bare-bones narrative.</snippet>
