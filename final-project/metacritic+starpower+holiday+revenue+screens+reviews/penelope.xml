         <snippet>An extraordinarily charming movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are some flat moments, to be sure, and Palansky's direction can be a bit unsteady and awkward, but he doesn't wallow in the eccentricities or the modestly self-empowering moral. This fairy tale feels pleasantly down-to-earth.</snippet>

         <snippet>This half-baked fairy tale always seems to be on the verge of becoming charming but despite a good cast it never quite succeeds.</snippet>

         <snippet>Aimed at tweenage girls and mushy romantics of all age and stripe, Penelope has a quick gait and a nice comic tone.</snippet>

         <snippet>More tart than sweet, this contemporary fairy tale provides a worthy vehicle for the fearless Christina Ricci.</snippet>

         <snippet>Anyone willing to tolerate the tortured premise of the story will be paid off handsomely by several winning performances and a moral that makes most of the absurdity worthwhile.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is an entertaining comedy for young girls and older girls who still like a good romantic fable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Reese Witherspoon, whose production company made Penelope, contributes an inflated cameo that feels forced.</snippet>

         <snippet>An endearing premise and fanciful spirit aren't quite enough to rescue a film that has more heart than smarts.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not the best of modern fairy tales but it's sincere and Christina Ricci's earnest and vulnerable performance touches the heart. Penelope is flawed but not irredeemably so.</snippet>

         <snippet>A first film from director Mark Palansky, written by sitcom veteran Leslie Caveny        (Everybody Loves Raymond, Mad About You), and the two are obviously indebted to the fanciful imagination of Tim Burton.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ricci is appealingly human, and some acknowledgement of the importance of female friendship, in addition to romance, is faintly touching.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>First-time director Mark Palansky is trying for a deft, hip, modern fairy-tale feel, but the odd material, sprawling story, and complicated tonal balancing act get away from him, and the film winds up as a poorly paced tug-of-war between sweet quirk and sloppy camp.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are usually good reasons why a movie gets shelved for more than a year, however well-acted it may be and however well-meaning its message. Many are on view in Penelope.</snippet>

         <snippet>The whimsical ugly-duckling fable becomes more uneven as it proceeds, straining too hard to manufacture its quirky charms.</snippet>

         <snippet>I found the sight of McAvoy as a piano player in jazzy-seedy duds a lot more disconcerting than Ricci's porcine prosthesis.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's no real rigor or craft applied to this story -- just mood, tone, neo-gothic imagery and frantic attitude. If only Penelope knew what it truly wished to be and how to go about it. Which is probably what this overly coy fantasy's modestly appealing title character wishes as well.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Too heavy on applied charm and too flimsy when it comes to plot. The picture has a hapless, meandering quality that's tolerable at first but ultimately becomes maddening, as if it were a cartoon narrative recounted by a distracted 4-year-old.</snippet>
