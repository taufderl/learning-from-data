         <snippet>The result is a wacked kiddie Rashomon in which the different versions dovetail with a logic as impeccable as it is flat-out buggy. So who do we root for? Everyone and no one. Hoodwinked's most radical feature is that it's a ride without heroes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hoodwinked hasn't much time for soul or sentiment, but it is certainly amusingly smart and sassy.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's no getting around the fact that it all looks like a cutscene from a kiddie video game. It's a great showreel. Now someone give these folks a real budget so they can make a movie that looks as good as it sounds.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hoodwinked treats "Red Riding Hood" as a detective story we've never really understood until now, with nuttier motivations, more complex characters and a screwier climax.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zippily written and directed by the team of Cory Edwards, Todd Edwards and Tony Leech, Hoodwinked just wants the audience to have fun - something that's been in sparse supply in theaters of late.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hoodwinked may be a poor cousin to the Shrek franchise, but this made-on-the-cheap computer-animated feature still has more style and snarky gags than Disney's recent CG hit, "Chicken Little."</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its chatty, overstuffed patter, Hoodwinked strains at the seams to look with it, like one of those dressed-alike Beverly Hills mother-daughter combos. Having said all that, the songs (yes, there are songs, too), mostly written by Todd Edwards, provide an unexpected bright spot.</snippet>

         <snippet>The superior animation we've seen over the last few years has raised the bar for family entertainment like Hoodwinked, which features lackluster character design, so-so animation and only fitful bursts of cleverness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like an early Woody Allen film or a classic Marx brothers feature, more of Hoodwinked's gags flop than hit, but they come at such a steady rate, you hardly notice.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Too archly scripted to appeal to kids and too crudely executed to win over older aficionados. The cheap-looking CGI makes the animals creepy rather than engaging, and a plot thread about a series of thefts does little more than spin the tale to feature length.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's voice talent is good, as are the characterizations. However, the film's computer animation leaves much to be desired.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hoodwinked occupies some considerably shaky turf situated uncomfortably between "Shrek" and dreck.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sluggishly paced and stiffly animated, Hoodwinked pulls out all the stops to keep its attention-deficient audience occupied, but the snowboarding, skiing, hang-gliding, and kung fu sequences will still be a lot more fun in the Hoodwinked video game.</snippet>

         <snippet>The "Puppetoonish" characters in Hoodwinked didn't bother me: They're primitive and inexpressive, but their personalities come through.  In fact, the problem is that their personalities do come through: They're all wackily sarcastic, unfunny nonentities.</snippet>

         <snippet>Less sassy than shrill, more crass than clever, the maiden cartoon from the Weinstein Company turns the Little Red Riding Hood legend into a sub- "Shrek" bummer that appears to have been manufactured for the pleasure of tone-deaf kids with a thing for sarcasm, extreme sports, and Andy Dick.</snippet>
