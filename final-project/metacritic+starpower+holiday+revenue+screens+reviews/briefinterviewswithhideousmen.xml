         <snippet>One hell of a date movie. A surgical examination of the male psyche based on David Foster Wallace's book and written and directed by John Krasinski, there is plenty of food for thought and argument.</snippet>

         <snippet>At times, the movie could have been called "Me and You and  Every One of the Bastards We Know," but Krasinski preserves Wallace's whooshing roller coasters of words, powered by the fuel of confession.</snippet>

         <snippet>Raises the question of whether Krasinski made this movie because he really loves Wallace’s work, or because just he wanted to show Hollywood that the loveable doof from The Office can actually act.</snippet>

         <snippet>An insightful, sharply written and unsettlingly amusing exploration of the darker elements of masculinity.</snippet>

         <snippet>In his directorial debut, Krasinski doesn't seem to believe in his hideous men so much as he appears intimidated by them.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is intelligent, well crafted and often funny, but it may not sufficiently reward even the brief time it asks one to spend with such hideous men.</snippet>

         <snippet>If we learn nothing else about Krasinski as a filmmaker, it’s that he thinks more is more.</snippet>

         <snippet>What this arid and arty exercise offers is the opportunity for a bunch of actors, many of them tethered to TV series, to deliver theatrical monologues pulsing with misogyny and narcissism. It's like second-rate Neil Labute.</snippet>

         <snippet>A blast from the 1980s, when the idea that men were essentially rapists and women rapees was a popular way to score chicks on campus.</snippet>

         <snippet>They’re not all hideous, the men who sit for interviews with a graduate student (Nicholson) and unload their dirty laundry. Sometimes they’re just feckless, or crass; some are even pitiable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Faced with the unenviable choice between honoring his daunting inspiration and telling his own story, the director shoots straight down the middle -- and misses both targets.</snippet>

         <snippet>Compacted into an 80-minute mishmash of interviews, confessions and sketches, melded into a shaky mosaic, the answers from a cross section of men are shallow, self-serving and ultimately unenlightening.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a very academic movie about academics that belongs in academia, not movie theaters.</snippet>

         <snippet>The question is, could someone turn these full-frontal-dudity snapshots into a satisfying, cohesive movie? Answer: no, but not for lack of trying.</snippet>
