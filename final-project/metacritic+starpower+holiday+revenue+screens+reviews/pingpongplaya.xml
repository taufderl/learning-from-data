         <snippet>A mostly amusing, appealing family comedy about going from pretender to contender, in life as well as pingpong.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yu has a good time making fun of white people, in particular a pair of rival ping-pong teachers who seem inspired by the gay villains in the Bond film "Diamonds Are Forever."</snippet>

         <snippet>A bright, nimble diversion, a quick-witted picture that's fast on its feet.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tsai, who co-wrote the script with Yu, pulls out all the stops with his C-dub role, brimming with witty send-ups of Chinese-American cultural values and Asian stereotypes.</snippet>

         <snippet>A good, clean, fun comedy that uses a table tennis championship to crack inside jokes about Los Angeles' Chinese-American community.</snippet>

         <snippet>He's a mishmash of cultural opposites, and his motormouth swagger is fitfully amusing. So is his backhand.</snippet>

         <snippet>Frantically paced, littered with cute kids, and overstuffed with split screens and a rap score, Ping Pong Playa angles a little too hard for tween attention, but there's no resisting the movie's antic affability or its irreverence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Breathes fresh life into the tired, bloated sports-comedy formula -- while remaining utterly formulaic.</snippet>

         <snippet>This thin premise can't sustain a feature, and the racial and gay jokes are jarring, but the child actors are cute, especially Andrew.</snippet>
