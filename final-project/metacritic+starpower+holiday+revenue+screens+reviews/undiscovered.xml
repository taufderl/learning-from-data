         <snippet>It isn't a really good movie, but there's real talent in it.</snippet>

         <snippet>An enjoyably cheesy teen melodrama with a touch of indie edge.</snippet>

         <snippet>The trouble with Undiscovered isn't that it's actively annoying but it's so dramatically listless it seems determined to become Unremembered.</snippet>

         <snippet>It doesn't belong at a megaplex. It should be playing on a Clear Channel station.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is a good movie here--Strait actually sings the songs that stand on their own, and he's appealing, despite the rock movie cliches.</snippet>

         <snippet>The whole movie could be clipped by about 95 minutes and it would make a swell little video for Simpson's performance of the title cut from the soundtrack.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a cautionary drama on the price of fame, Undiscovered could not tread on more exhaustively discovered territory, and the result is a reel-by-reel trail of cliches.</snippet>

         <snippet>Undiscovered is beaten on all counts by TVâ€™s "Entourage" and "Unscripted" in its portrayal of the aspirational lifestyle and its end-of-the-rainbow spoils.</snippet>

         <snippet>On paper, the "rising stars" of Meiert Avis' low-flying romantic comedy Undiscovered are Steven Strait and Pell James, but the real star is Tyson the Skateboarding Dog.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tailored for the readership of Teen People magazine and about as thought-provoking as the average 500-word celebrity profile.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though filled with romantic contrivances and overlong musical numbers, Undiscovered is curiously lifeless. Bland actors portray single-cell characters in a plot scarcely more diverting than Ms. Simpson's reality vehicle, "The Ashlee Simpson Show."</snippet>

         <snippet>The vapid teen talent show Undiscovered turns on a plot point so moronic that even the most dedicated bad-movie buffs have cause to stay away.</snippet>

         <snippet>A PG-13 dramedy set in L.A. about some attractive, way-too-earnest aspiring stars has the potential to be a delectable good-bad favorite, but Undiscovered is nowhere near the guilty pleasure it could have been.</snippet>

         <snippet>An entirely dispensable, soapy caricature of a love story that comes complete with a jukebox full of music industry cliches plus Ashlee Simpson's big feature film debut.</snippet>

         <snippet>As Brier's comrade-in-lip-gloss, Ashlee Simpson, dressed to look like a teenybop girl version of Crispin Glover in "River's Edge," is the real deal -- in fake cred.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie plays more like a WB network teen drama than something audiences should be expected to pay to see.</snippet>

         <snippet>Undiscovered promotes one of the stupidest visions of the entertainment industry since "American Idol" opened the celebrity gateway to the dregs of the karaoke generation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Indeed, I'd say Undiscovered belongs on the WB, but that would be gravely unfair to the channel, which looks like the BBC in comparison.</snippet>
