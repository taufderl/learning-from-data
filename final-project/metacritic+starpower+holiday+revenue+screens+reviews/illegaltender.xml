         <snippet>Quite an entertaining genre piece boasting a terrifically sinewy lead performance from Wanda De Jesus.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's a genuine oddity: a Latino action drama with one foot in bullet-spitting genre flicks -- '70s blaxploitation and '80s coke-kingpin films are the primary reference points -- and the other in raggedly personal family melodrama.</snippet>

         <snippet>As it is, Illegal Tender works as a melodrama, and it benefits enormously from the performance of Wanda DeJesus.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too muted to have much lasting impact, and remains modestly diverting only on a scene-to-scene basis. There's no quotable dialogue, no standout action sequence, no flashy supporting performances -- in short, nothing to lift Illegal Tender from the level of competent but inconsequential B-movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a second, the movie has the snap of a truly surprising thriller -- like a Hispanic "Kill Bill" -- about an aging lioness willing to kill to protect her cub.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pistol-packing De Jesus evokes Pam Grier in spots but certainly holds her own.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never gets the mixture right, lurching between bullet-happy shootouts and overwrought domestic content.</snippet>

         <snippet>A throwback to 1970s blaxploitation flicks, with a Latin accent, Illegal Tender would be a brassy, sassy guilty pleasure if it were more, well, pleasurable.</snippet>

         <snippet>This tale of crime and punishment is wrapped in a veneer of flashy attitude but founders on mundane details.</snippet>

         <snippet>What kind of movie is misdirected, poorly acted, preposterously written--and still wholly entertaining? A B-movie, of course. While Illegal Tender has misguided pretensions towards Serious Filmmaking, it's surprisingly likeable if you see it instead as a cheesy thriller good for a lazy Friday night.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a film about growing up, Illegal Tender loses itself in a lot of silly juvenilia.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's one bright spot is Gonzalez, a refreshingly natural young actor who needs to get out of B-movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Illegal Tender echoes "A History of Violence," another gritty film that explores escaping a criminal past. But the vast vapidity behind Illegal Tender's ill-conceived story line is far harder to overcome.</snippet>

         <snippet>Luridly earnest and laughably immoral, Illegal Tender is an old genre movie with a new look. Call it Hispanixploitation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Illegal Tender is the sort of crime movie in which nothing, not one detail, has been observed from real life; it's composed entirely of fantasies and falsehoods lifted from bad movies and hip-hop videos.</snippet>
