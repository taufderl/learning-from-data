         <snippet>Every movie about the Holocaust should be this good, but few are.</snippet>

         <snippet>Commands attention from its very first frame and never lets up right through the fade-out. It is a splendid example of classic screen storytelling with no false steps, and Gansel's understated approach pays off with resounding emotional effect and meaning.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like its singular central character, Before the Fall stands out from the pack.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gansel based the film on the memories of one of his grandfathers. The acting is believable; the photography, atmospheric; and the moral, unmistakable.</snippet>

         <snippet>All the paraphernalia so important to the image of the Reich, particularly the uniforms, are painstakingly rendered, bringing a heightened sense of realism to what might otherwise have been a romantic coming-of-age tale.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Before the Fall feels a tad overdetermined, it also feels emotionally honest. Calmly and carefully, Mr. Gansel makes large points with small scenes.</snippet>

         <snippet>The hero (played with the right amount of adolescent insouciance by Max Riemelt) is a working-class boy admitted to one of the academies for his formidable boxing skills, and through him director Dennis Gansel captures the ordinariness of Hitler's supporters.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's an emotionally chilly movie with a blank, inexpressive protagonist, but it gains cumulative force en route to a viscerally moving climax.</snippet>

         <snippet>This well-made World War II film from Germany is both a coming-of-age story and a critique of National Socialist ideology.</snippet>

         <snippet>When movie clich√©s are presented with rigor and feeling, they can pack a fresh punch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unusually compelling, even if it's treacly enough to be "The Chorus" in goose step.</snippet>

         <snippet>The homoerotic relationship between Friedrich and Albrecht is stopped short by tragedy, but the point is made - to Friedrich and the audience - that fascism has no room for humanity.</snippet>

         <snippet>An intermittently gripping story about an idealistic young boxer who becomes disillusioned with the Third Reich during his elite training, Napola is finally KO'd by an overdose of Nazi fetishism.</snippet>

         <snippet>Surely played better on the page than on the screen. What's left is the same old drill driven by brutal master race fervor.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is a competent but callow work dealing with a monstrous subject that automatically rejects callowness.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is too middlebrow to show us the superman-type sexual heroics they must've engaged in, or even allow the illicit subtext to float to the surface (as Sokurov does in Father and Son)--instead we get tepid moralizing on dehumanization in the military.</snippet>
