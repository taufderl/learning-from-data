         <snippet>The movie is legitimately greasy, authentically nasty, with a good old-fashioned sense of laying waste to everything in sight -- including the shallow philosophizing and computer-generated fakery that have overrun the summer blockbuster.</snippet>

         <snippet>Statham is an essential tough guy, what the Brits call "well'ard," as self-assured as Lee Marvin.</snippet>

         <snippet>It honestly delivers the goods without all the preachy moralizing about violent entertainment and cultural ruin.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nothing in director Paul W.S. Anderson's schlock drawer--prepares you for the peppy, good-time nastiness that is Death Race.</snippet>

         <snippet>Statham moves with such easy grace that you don't have to work hard to believe him. And if he can stand up to Joan Allen, melting her predatory stare with his own molten gaze, then it's clear he's not just the prettiest guy on the prison block, but also the toughest.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the picture doesn't deserve to appear on any critic's 10-best list, it observes the minimum standards of modern action films, which is to say it looks smarter, talks sassier and moves faster than almost anything else on the market.</snippet>

         <snippet>Soft sexual and racial jabs replace the more daring political commentary of the original, a crude classic from the Roger Corman factory.</snippet>

         <snippet>This new version has absolutely none of the distinctive tongue-in-cheek black humor that was the keynote of its model and the trademark of its original director, Paul Bartel.</snippet>

         <snippet>This movie is about mayhem on wheels, tough guys viewers can root for, and villains whose comeuppances audiences crave. That's what Death Race is all about and, for what it is, it does a solid job.</snippet>

         <snippet>Smartly, Anderson makes some eclectic casting choices that keep the story from feeling as though it's populated by video-game characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's nothing more than an enjoyable, ridiculously macho B-movie romp, but it's derson' best movie since the underrated Event Horizon. Perhaps, at long last, he' starting to find his - yep - top gear.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's the perfect end-of-summer film, and a sign that summer needs to end soon.</snippet>

         <snippet>The best you can say about the movie is that it isn't boring. It's fast-paced, but it isn't really well made.</snippet>

         <snippet>It isn't so much a movie as a superheated, highly conductive miracle substance for the pure transmission of masculine aggression and misogyny.</snippet>

         <snippet>As hard as metal and just as dumb, Paul W.S. Anderson's Death Race couldn't be further from producer Roger Corman and director Paul Bartel's goofy, bloody 1975 original, "Death Race 2000."</snippet>

         <snippet>Paul Bartel's "Death Race 2000" is a beloved camp item, but this slick, loud, violent remake is pitched at the video game crowd.</snippet>

         <snippet>Well, you've got to say this for Death Race:  It knows what it is and doesn't apologize for it. What it is, incidentally, is junk.</snippet>

         <snippet>Anderson has neutered the original film's outrageously transgressive macadam mayhem and completely stripped the story of its pointedly political social satire, making this Death Race one of the most boring drags of all time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Here's hoping Allen's static Hennessey is due to an extreme acting choice and not plastic surgery. It would be tragic to lose a natural smile to star in garbage like Death Race.</snippet>
