         <snippet>The result is yet another tired, ultimately incoherent horror movie that undoes the promise of its pretty good premise and potentially interesting story structure with dull scares, sloppy ending and a pair of unconvincing, leaden lead performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>On the shortlist for least essential movie of the decade, a copy of a copy of a copy that's so worn down, it's about as fresh and vital as a fifth-generation dub of "The Star Wars Holiday Special."</snippet>

         <snippet>This decent if derivative scare machine should benefit from a lack of genre competition.</snippet>

         <snippet>While director Eric Valette provides the occasional chill, the disturbing spooks aren't enough to make this boat float. Burns sleepwalks through One Missed Call totally devoid of charisma, and Sossamon muddles along, going through the motions.</snippet>

         <snippet>With his preferences for static, colorless visuals and exposition-laden dialogue over conversation, director Valette has now set the bar for the worst film of 2008.</snippet>

         <snippet>This garbled American remake of Takashi Miike's already staticky 2004 exercise in J-horror is a wrong number.</snippet>

         <snippet>One Missed Call was originally a so-so Takashi Miike freak-out. Now it's a worse-worse American eyesore.</snippet>

         <snippet>The original movie One Missed Call is based on was pretty tame, at least by Miike standards. And since it appears studios have no intention of halting this flood of abysmal rehashes, allow me to suggest that they at least have the stones not to pussyfoot around and give us a remake worthy of Hollywood, of America, and of an audience that lacks the willpower to stop buying tickets to half-assed crap.</snippet>
