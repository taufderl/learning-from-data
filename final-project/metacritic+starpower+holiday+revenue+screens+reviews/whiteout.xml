         <snippet>A conventionally jam-packed, dutifully ludicrous action thriller.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the setting can be mesmerizing, little else about this movie is captivating.</snippet>

         <snippet>Briefly, not knowing who has the upper hand is exciting, but as the fight wears on, it becomes irritating.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its stunning natural landscape notwithstanding, Antarctica-set thriller Whiteout, a frozen concoction of red herrings, incongruous plot points and thinly developed characters, will leave auds cold.</snippet>

         <snippet>No event occurs without a character telling us what we're seeing. This unwelcome commentary is so overdone that it becomes, by the end, an invitation for audience participation. All together now: It's a body! Looks like it's been shot in the head!</snippet>

         <snippet>Instead of being sharp and stylish, the picture just meanders pointlessly toward its allegedly surprising conclusion, dragging the actors along with it. Nearly everything about it is heavy and off-balance, like an overloaded sled.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kate Beckinsale is about as convincing a U.S. Marshal as Joan Crawford is a loving mother. But like that megastar of yesteryear, she gets a helluva terrific entrance in the Antarctica-set murder mystery Whiteout.</snippet>

         <snippet>It could be said that Whiteout is an honest attempt to set an old-fashioned whodunit in an exotic locale, but the mystery at the filmâ€™s core is so hopelessly dull that one begins to long for a third-act cameo by the Abominable Snowman.</snippet>

         <snippet>In a bad movie, no one can hear you scream, Kate. Or really appreciate your shower scene, for that matter.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Whiteout is a ham-handed murder mystery that starts out average and heads south from there, falling apart under the pressures of graceless camerawork, leaps of illogic, and TV-movie production values.</snippet>

         <snippet>Some films feel off from the get-go. They don't hang together, despite the best intentions. Whiteout, a singularly unsuspenseful, unexciting, unthrilling Arctic thriller starring Underworld's Kate Beckinsale, isn't exactly one of these. It's even worse.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even a bad thriller can be entertaining, and this gory murder mystery set in Antarctica has a certain dumb fascination -- up to a point. Then it is defeated by its sheer idiocy.</snippet>

         <snippet>By the time this thing creaked to a close, the look on my face suggested Jack Nicholson at the end of "The Shining."</snippet>

         <snippet>So staggeringly bad that it achieves a kind of transcendent poetry. It's ignorant of how things are in the real world, of what makes a thriller a thriller, of why people seek out entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's slick and expensive looking but dumber than a dead penguin, and director Dominic Sena fails worst where it counts most, in staging intelligible action sequences set in a blinding blizzard.</snippet>
