         <snippet>As for Grant, who hasn't been this sharp since "Love Actually" six years ago, he is once again the prime minister of cute comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a thoroughly delightful throwaway--the kind of movie for which cable television was made, from the maker of "Music &amp; Lyrics" (Marc Lawrence), who knows his way 'round a snappy tune.</snippet>

         <snippet>But the charm of the film is that it resists turning people into cliches and lets Parker and Grant work their particular magic -- before they get to Wyoming, their performances are as stressed out as their characters, and while it's a dubious conceit that going cowboy is a cure-all, they put the notion across as convincingly as possible.</snippet>

         <snippet>Neither good nor bad. Scales dizzying new heights of okay. Aims for mediocrity... and nails it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not even the estimable comic chops of Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker can lift it above the level of ordinary.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker are supposed to pass for a married couple, but they have all the chemistry of two actors who just met and shook hands moments before the cameras rolled. They don't even seem to like each other much.</snippet>

         <snippet>You should hear instead about Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen, who whip up cowboy fun as married U.S. marshals assigned to protect the pair in Wyoming.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the movie isn’t "Witness," you know that comic scenes of target practice are going to make sense around the bend.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are barely enough titter-worthy one-liners in Marc Lawrence’s good-natured romantic comedy Did You Hear About the Morgans? to prevent it from sinking under the weight of its clichés.</snippet>

         <snippet>What possible reason was there for anyone to make Did You Hear About the Morgans? Or should I say "remake," because this movie has been made and over and over again, and oh, so much better.</snippet>

         <snippet>Given the creator and the cast, "Morgans" is as drearily predictable as a plague of locusts.</snippet>

         <snippet>Grant and Parker's talents are wasted on a boring, made-for-TV story punctuated by a contrived, throwaway third act.</snippet>

         <snippet>When the material gets really bad, as it does in the dismal Did You Hear About The Morgans?, Grant's pinched facial expressions become an inadvertent commentary on the movie he’s making, as if he plainly realizes that his one-liners are tanking.</snippet>

         <snippet>Grant and Parker stand around as if they’re waiting for someone to yell, “Cut.’’ He’s in one movie. She’s in another. Neither is any good.</snippet>
