         <snippet>Manages to distract auds from the predictability of the plot with fusillades of profanely funny dialogue and some playfully sexy chemistry generated by Cook and Hudson.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eventually the conventions of romantic comedy take hold, with the humor declining precipitously.</snippet>

         <snippet>A date not entirely to be skipped. It's a movie tailor-made for those who think it's a turn-on to passionately kiss someone to whom they've just said, "I hate you."</snippet>

         <snippet>The actors (especially Alec Baldwin, as Tank's horndog dad) elevate the material slightly, but such piffle will just fill you with longing...for a better movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>My Best Friend's Girl isn't just a misfire; it's a misfire compounded by a chain of miscalculations, and it's hard to figure out who this could appeal to (except, perhaps, Dane Cook's fan club).</snippet>

         <snippet>An ugly, strictly-for-meatheads comedy that can only be recommended to couples who wear matching Tie Domi Toronto Maple Leafs jerseys out on a date.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dane Cook plays a smug jerk in the dismal comedy My Best Friend's Girl. Strike that: He's only ACTING like a smug jerk.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately, its most unforgivable sin is that it's simply not funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>Say what you will about comedian-turned-actor Cook, the man is a force of nature, a tornado of verbal gymnastics and physical contortions who will do anything for a laugh.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tank's whole shtick is taking advantage of stupid women's desire to live in banal romantic comedies, but the film he's in is just as bad as any other Hudson movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is raunchier than expected, and above all clichéd, formulaic and thoroughly sexist. Worst, it's just not very funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>It lacks the courage of its swinish convictions, and abruptly acquiesces to bland rom-com clichés three-quarters of the way to its appointed end.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a cheap thrill in watching Hudson defuse Cook's pig antics with some foulness of her own.</snippet>
