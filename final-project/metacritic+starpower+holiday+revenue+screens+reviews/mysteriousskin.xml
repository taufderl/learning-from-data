         <snippet>This thoughtful, troubling drama is leagues above the sensationalistic stuff Araki peddled in earlier films.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's content is adult – and for the first time in Araki's career, so is the director.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not for the squeamish, but it is a beautifully crafted and thoughtful film that genuinely provokes.</snippet>

         <snippet>At once the most harrowing and, strangely, the most touching film I have seen about child abuse.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mysterious Skin dawdles more than it flows, but it comes alive whenever Araki, hovering between tragedy and voyeurism, reveals how sex can tear lives to pieces.</snippet>

         <snippet>An absorbing story. Even though it takes you to places you may not want to go, the film never loses its human touch--that feel of skin on skin or of the past inescapably invading the present.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is actually a major artistic breakthrough for Araki, a onetime bad boy of independent filmmaking. Its psychological intelligence, attention to emotional currents, and humanity are surprises.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mysterious Skin isn't a picture about existential vacancy; it isn't even about anything so simplistic as the horrors of child abuse. It's more of a meditation on the necessity of making your way past, or through, any obstacle that prevents you from being a thinking, feeling person.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's an ideal collaboration: A stylish director desperately seeking substance transforms the first, somewhat flat novel of a promising young writer into powerful and brutally honest film about a highly controversial subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>By turns spiky and lyrical, this unsettling drama will be anathema to many audiences, but is bound to be a provocative, talked-about release.</snippet>

         <snippet>Araki is trying to work from the inside out; and he captures feelings about sexual exploitation that I've never seen onscreen--not all of them negative.</snippet>

         <snippet>Corbet emerges as an actor of sensitivity and depth, but it’s Gordon-Levitt who steals every scene as the damaged, destructive but ultimately sympathetic rent boy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mostly, Mysterious Skin creeps you out, and not in any kind of fun way. There's an artfulness to it, but it's hard to imagine many viewers actually using the term "enjoyed" or "entertained" in conjunction with it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Had Araki chosen to illuminate, rather than exploit, the traumatic aftermath of child molestation, his wallow in the horrors of Mysterious Skin might have had a purpose. As it stands, his film is just another trashy look at America as the land of imbecilic perverts.</snippet>
