         <snippet>Mackenzie delivers that story as a blend of sex comedy, dark satire, and morality tale that recalls various aspects of "Shampoo" and "Less Than Zero" and "The Graduate," but has a couple of nifty surprises and a poisonous sting in its tail that's all its own.</snippet>

         <snippet>Props to Kutcher for going to surprising, painful places. There's something haunted in his portrayal that hits hard and sticks.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kutcher gives a surprisingly proficient performance as does Heche who is the shining star of the film.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of the best things about this film is that ultimately nobody in it is attractive.</snippet>

         <snippet>If only Spread were half as entertaining as a Van Halen video.</snippet>

         <snippet>More skin is shown in Spread than in most Hollywood movies. But despite twitches of insight into its characters and their world, Spread refuses go more than skin deep.</snippet>

         <snippet>The whole movie is pat -- very pleased with itself for being so up front about the ways of a 21st-century man-whore.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although Kutcher deserves some ­credit for trying to spread his professional wings, it quickly becomes clear that he's in over his head.</snippet>

         <snippet>It comes off as an unpleasant, unrealistic morality tale. Loaded with music and pretty bodies, the film has a chance to lasso a young, indiscriminate audience of Kutcher fans.</snippet>

         <snippet>With "Shampoo" and "American Gigolo" now distant memories, the time evidently seemed ripe for another Hollywood stud movie. Despite Ashton Kutcher’s believability as an older woman’s kept boy, Spread isn’t a patch on those previous films.</snippet>

         <snippet>A witless homage to "Shampoo" and "American Gigolo" that's brain-dead on arrival.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lamely tries to update "Breakfast at Tiffany’s" for the Twitter set. Too bad Truman Capote’s not around for rewrites.</snippet>
