         <snippet>Marks a return to a not-so-distant time when horror movies weren't soul-rotting atrocities but just enjoyably bad.</snippet>

         <snippet>Until this past Friday, the worst werewolf film ever made was, hairy hands down, Mike Nichols' "Wolf."  Cursed now assumes that dubious distinction and someone is going to have to try very hard to wrestle it away.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though Craven shows flashes of the old magic, Cursed eventually settles into rote, uninspired horror fare, hog-tied to the Williamson formula all the way to arbitrary finish. The film may be one of the best ever not screened in advance for critics, but that still doesn't put it in the finest company.</snippet>

         <snippet>Outdoes recent releases such as "Boogeyman" in the fright department, but the "Dawson's Creek" sensitivity and unsatisfying effects undermine the lupine anxiety.</snippet>

         <snippet>The problem lies with Williamson's script, which feels as if it has been torn from different places and glued back together like a ransom note.</snippet>

         <snippet>Poor special effects, a silly looking werewolf and clunky comic writing help to spoil what should have been a fun B-movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>More an uninspired letdown than a flabbergasting turkey... One reason for this lack of bite lies in the werewolves themselves. They're a bit too teddy-bearish, even oddly cuddly, and the fright scenes work better when you don't see much of them.</snippet>

         <snippet>Except for Eisenberg's superb comic timing and his ability to make the familiar seem interesting, the high school scenes play like "Scream" outtakes.</snippet>

         <snippet>If there's the kernel of a good story buried somewhere deep in Cursed, it never pops. As werewolf movies go, this one is on par with "An American Werewolf in Paris," but at least that dud had plenty of gore and Julie Delpy's bare breasts to recommend it.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not bad enough to make you curse, but you are likely to laugh when you should scream, and to roll your eyes when you are meant to laugh.</snippet>

         <snippet>Screenwriter Kevin Williamson (the Scream trilogy), having bottomed out in the horror genre, now dips below bottom (there isn't a line that has his knowing sweet-and-sour zing).</snippet>

         <snippet>It's hard to tell who is more Cursed - the pretty young people who turn into werewolves on screen or the people who buy tickets for this slow, witless, predictable horror flick.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike Cursed, which resorts to blatant but unconvincing gore and violence, "The Wolf Man" (1941) gets its point across through suggestion, makeup and spooky sets.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film vacillates between inanity and flat-out lameness, and the decision to recut from an R-rated version to a PG-13 sucked out whatever life might have been left.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cursed, a modern-day werewolf tale that fails to provide either Craven's trademark chills or Williamson's trademark satirical wit, is a distinctly subpar film that, but for the current boxoffice streak enjoyed by such formulaic genre entries, deserved to go direct to video.</snippet>
