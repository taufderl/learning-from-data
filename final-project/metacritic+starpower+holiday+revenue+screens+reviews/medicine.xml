         <snippet>There are no simple answers or obvious conclusions to be gleaned from this movie, which, like its soundtrack, is both sad and vibrant, meandering and formally sure-footed. It is an exciting debut, and a film that, without exaggeration or false modesty, finds interest and feeling in the world just as it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film falters only when it eavesdrops briefly on a passionate public discussion of rent control and gentrification. The moment is out of keeping with the carefree nature of the rest of the movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Medicine For Melancholy offers a personal spin on the "walking around a city" genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>Under the subdued, dignified surface, this movie - about the 24 hours after a one-night stand - churns with a filmmaker's fascination and wonder, sadness and longing.</snippet>

         <snippet>The narrative, at times, veers into overstatement, but for the most part we're allowed to eavesdrop on their self-examination guilt-free.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jenkins has an admirable feeling for, as the French would say, mise en sc√®ne, and a gift for placing actors in naturalistic settings. What he lacks at this point is a strong story sense.</snippet>

         <snippet>So subtle and subdued that it nearly undercuts itself. I'd describe it, in fact, as a film that doesn't quite work -- but the way it doesn't work is so distinctive and so interesting that it marks Jenkins as an exciting new face on the American indie scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wyatt Cenac, the latest addition to "The Daily Show" With Jon Stewart, is the best reason to see this easygoing romantic comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film does not lack for ambition both in terms of its themes and artistic design. Consequently, his (Jenkins) feature debut, while not flashy, shows promise. Clearly, here is a young filmmaker who wants to tell stories rather than deliver shocks and sensation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jenkins is so desperate to give his love story a social and economic context that he stops the movie cold for a bunch of unrelated white people to articulate their grievances over gentrification--it's as if "Annie Hall" had paused for a seminar on agrarian reform.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yet it's pretty in all the wrong ways: pretty slight, pretty preachy and pretty affected.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cenac is witty and Heggins has a wary stillness, but the movie itself seems too shy to let them really engage each other.</snippet>
