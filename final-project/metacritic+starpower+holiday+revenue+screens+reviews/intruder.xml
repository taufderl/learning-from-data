         <snippet>The Intruder, is a decisive breakthrough--her (Claire Denis) most poetic and primal film to date, as thrilling as it is initially baffling.</snippet>

         <snippet>Enigmatic as it is, The Intruder dares us to see movies as visual marvels tethered to humanity.</snippet>

         <snippet>For Denis’ film - which may be her most intricately constructed and intensely beautiful to date - is one that transcends words and stories, a movie to be felt rather than rationalized.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never has Denis demanded so much from audiences as with this shimmering enigma, at once intimate and epic, but it's worth the effort and then some.</snippet>

         <snippet>Exhilarating and exhausting, the kind of picture you don't bounce back from immediately. Yet its elusiveness is the very source of its poetic energy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The title might as well refer to the viewer who tags along on Louis' often-silent journey from solitude to some tentative form of family. Some will consider the experience insurmountably frustrating; others will find it exhilarating.</snippet>

         <snippet>So, should you see The Intruder? Yes -- but only if you're willing to ignore bothersome concerns about narrative and let the poetic images take over your mind.</snippet>

         <snippet>Surrealism is one thing, but The Intruder appears so ill defined and random that it ends up looking simply inept.</snippet>
