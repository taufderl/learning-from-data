         <snippet>Beautifully acted, structurally sophisticated heart-tugger.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a gentle look at people who cut themselves off from others and realize consequences too late. If Southern Baptists believed in karma, this would be their touchstone.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kirkman is shrewd enough to coax a wistful performance out of pretty boy Kip Pardue.</snippet>

         <snippet>This movie takes its sweet time wrapping together three related tales set in various regions of North Carolina -- to ultimately devastating effect.</snippet>

         <snippet>Slow, unadorned, compassionate, and earnest, Loggerheads is a low-fi throwback to the independent films of the 1980s and '90s.</snippet>

         <snippet>Developments unfold according to the needs of the characters. The movie is not about springing surprises on us, but about showing these people in a process of discovery. The performances are not pitched toward melodrama; the actors all find the right notes and rhythms for scenes in which life goes on and everything need not be solved in three lines of dialogue.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a film in a naturalistic mode, Loggerheads gets a shade too elliptical at its finish but still leaves a deep impression as to how irrevocable life's choices can be.</snippet>

         <snippet>If it isn't easy being any of the troubled people wandering through the film, Loggerheads makes it easy not only to believe in them, but to care about them as well.</snippet>

         <snippet>Undeniably precious, it may make some viewers fidgety, but others will find that the reflective melancholy that overcomes both director and cast (all superb) is a sweet contagion.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the third story, set in Asheville, N.C., that excellent actress Hunt guides us steadily through what could be a minefield of sentimentality.</snippet>

         <snippet>This has its sappy moments, but both women give wonderfully detailed performances, aided by Michael Learned as Hunt's mother and Chris Sarandon as the calm, cold minister.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Loggerheads sometimes feels too forced, it features some unforgettable performances, especially by Hunt, an accomplished comedienne who makes an impressive debut as a dramatic lead here.</snippet>

         <snippet>Full of compassion and good intentions, but Kirkman never spins the stories into compelling cinema.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's all in the telling, and Loggerheads practically aches with its own heal-the-world earnestness.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's so much ache in this plaintive little film that it almost makes you believe that the entire world is composed of estranged parents and children searching in vain for one another.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hunt and, especially, Harper do excellent work rounding out sketchily-written roles. But Pardue, who offers little beyond movie-star
looks, is either miscast or genuinely unable to grasp his character's intense longing and insecurity.</snippet>

         <snippet>A drama that is more contemplative at times than dramatic yet one containing several powerful moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>As impatient as I was with Loggerheads, I can't hate it. The sincerity of its performances is too real; its compassion for its characters is too strong. On the other hand, I haven't mentioned yet that the loggerhead is a species of turtle.</snippet>
