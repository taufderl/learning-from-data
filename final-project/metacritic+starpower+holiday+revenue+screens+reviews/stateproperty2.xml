         <snippet>You may call the film blingsploitation but its fun-loving hoodlums know who's fooling whom.</snippet>

         <snippet>Slicker, funnier and more professional than its predecessor, State Property 2, with Damon Dash at its helm tones down the original.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dash directs with a certain visual flare and a sense of humor, but as the film lumbers toward its climax, keeping track of the innumerable allegiances and double-crosses becomes an exercise in futility.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is not saying much to point out that the sequel is better than its predecessor (directed by Abdul Malik Abbott), which was crude and amateurish in every way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately, Adam Moreno's screenplay, with its multiple narrators and constantly shifting points of view, makes for mighty confusing viewing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dash and screenwriter Adam "Blue" Moreno abandon the stone-faced seriousness of the first film for a more playful approach, goofing on gangsta' poses and colorful hood-speak.</snippet>

         <snippet>When this flick is honest about its pimping, it has that Rat Pack charm. But attempts at real ruggish posturing--like that de rigueur sideways-gatted, full-body-exposure firing stance--are just plain laughable.</snippet>

         <snippet>State Property 2 is no more three-dimensional than your average brand-name-laden hip-hop video.</snippet>

         <snippet>Given that its predecessor hit bottom in the glorification of thug thrills, State Property 2 had nowhere to go but up. Yet, it doesn't.</snippet>

         <snippet>The left hand doesn't know who the right hand is shooting in State Property 2, Damon Dash's prodigiously muddled thug-life sequel.</snippet>
