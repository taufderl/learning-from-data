         <snippet>Blossoms of Fire fulfills the first criterion of any good ethnographic study: It's about an inherently interesting subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's easy to be seduced by this film's warmhearted, if slightly utopian, vision.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the subject is potentially fascinating, Gosling's unfocused, sluggish film is a case study in missed opportunities.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ethnographic segments about the natives' daily life are bridged by expressive folk songs, though the film digresses to consider colonialism, homosexuality, and the effects of globalization on indigenous cultures. Gosling's schoolmarmish narration betrays the filmmakers' awestruck naivete toward the culture, which they seem to consider some sort of matriarchal utopia.</snippet>

         <snippet>Results at times seem as much p.c. travelogue as serious docu inquiry.</snippet>

         <snippet>Backed by folk songs and swirling shots of fiestas and markets, Blossoms is feel-good tourism but by its own bounds only woolly anthropology.</snippet>

         <snippet>Obviously, this is one subject which may not seem to require the attention of documentary filmmakers.</snippet>
