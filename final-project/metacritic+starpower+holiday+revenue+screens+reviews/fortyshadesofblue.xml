         <snippet>A compelling family melodrama somewhat in the manner of late John Cassavetes or early Robert Altmanâ€¦the film combines high production values, terrific acting and a distinctively American lyricism in a combination you hardly ever see these days.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alan, who Mr. Sachs has said was based on his own father, is a great character - passionate, complicated, bursting with life. Those words also describe Mr. Torn's performance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Ira Sachs moves to the rhythms of his native Memphis, teasing emotional resonance out of geography.</snippet>

         <snippet>The song may be somewhat familiar, but Sach gets understated performances from his entire cast and finds interesting harmonies as they play out their clashing duets.</snippet>

         <snippet>Investing a lot of time on each corner of his three-sided character piece, director Ira Sachs (who co-wrote the film with Michael Rohatyn) has created a film as dramatically intense as it is opaque.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is still powerful, undiluted stuff -- a jolt of backwoods moonshine whiskey injected into the veins of the atrophied American relationship drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sachs has pulled off a film of inferences and intimations, thanks largely to the casting of accomplished actors.</snippet>

         <snippet>I despised the character of Alan James so sincerely that I had to haul back at one point to remind myself that, hey, I've met Rip Torn and he's a nice guy and he's only acting.</snippet>

         <snippet>A muted but nicely observed study of a Russian woman's gradual estrangement from her domineering Memphis music-legend husband.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's Korzun's film, and she is in complete control of her character, never divulging too much of the haunted woman under the studied facade of American hotsiness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Repetitive interaction between characters in an aimless story can't hold up the film's weight, and it eventually collapses on its noble attempt to capture life's frustrations and compromises.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rip Torn and Darren Burrows respectively over- and underplay their hands in this archly restrained Memphis melodrama.</snippet>
