         <snippet>Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson bring credibility to Last Chance Harvey merely by their presence. The result is a holiday parfait.</snippet>

         <snippet>Last Chance Harvey is a tremendously appealing love story surrounded by a movie not worthy of it.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a pleasure to see mature portraits of adult characters who put their vulnerabilities on the line. I enjoyed my time in the company of these strangers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Harvey is so thin it barely registers as a movie, yet these two actors - British apples and American oranges in their respective approaches to character - almost miraculously weave something memorable out of nothing much.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stars Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson (reunited after 2006's "Stranger Than Fiction") are so disarmingly charming that even the most treacly moments work an emotional magic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sappy, sentimental and redeemed only by the quiet radiance and fidgety intelligence of its leads, Last Chance Harvey is a fantasy about mopey middle-agers getting a second chance at love.</snippet>

         <snippet>If nothing else, Last Chance Harvey proves that you're never too old to be the subject of a zany trying-on-dresses montage, but considering the prestige of its leads, that's a minor victory at best.</snippet>

         <snippet>Besides being old pros who could elevate such schmaltz in their sleep, Hoffman and Thompson -- despite the 20-plus years between them, and her graceful restraint in contrast to his creepy assertiveness -- have a genuinely sweet chemistry, which is the exact and only reason to seek this one out.</snippet>

         <snippet>This movie is genial, forgettable piffle about the perhaps-beginning of a maybe affair. It's a romantic daydream so slim that it barely leaves the requisite sweet aftertaste.</snippet>

         <snippet>All this gloomy masochism is made palatable because of the performers. And yet we must ask: Is this any way to show off two of our finest actors?</snippet>

         <snippet>Last Chance Harvey is so much an "actors' film" that the hand of the director seems hidden until it bursts into view with something clunky.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lately, most of Dustin Hoffman's roles have been grinning crackpots or talking animals, so accepting the 71-year-old actor as a romantic lead who could fetch the likes of Emma Thompson requires some suspension of disbelief.</snippet>

         <snippet>Witless banter might have won Ginger Rogers for Fred Astaire, but Thompson is too smart for that.</snippet>
