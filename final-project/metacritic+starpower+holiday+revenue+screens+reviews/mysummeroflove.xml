         <snippet>Superbly acted, movingly written, and directed with a tough-minded lyricism rarely found in today's films. A summer movie to love.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pawlikowski has made a romance that becomes a horror movie in which love, more than anything around it, is a delusionary fever to fear.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is as wonderfully realized an observation of female affinity as 1999â€™s great "The Dreamlife of Angels."</snippet>

         <snippet>Pawlikowski has made a gorgeously ambiguous film -- based upon a novel by Helen Cross -- that is blessedly hard to tag; in fact, it's a compilation of genres and moods -- comedy, romance and diabolical thriller -- and that is its core strength and freshness.</snippet>

         <snippet>So fraught with unresolved issues of class, sexuality, and spiritual need, and so carefully observed by Pawlikowski, that it opens out like the movie's West Yorkshire countryside.</snippet>

         <snippet>Press and Blunt are major discoveries: in this sly and wonderfully atmospheric gem, they conjure up the role-playing raptures of youth with perfect poetic pitch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its stars, Emily Blunt and Natalie Press, are film newcomers who give startling performances. The photography is often breathtakingly original.</snippet>

         <snippet>My Summer of Love may sound like the title of a hot teen flick, but it is a truly refreshing grown-up big-screen film, a rare gem in this summer of duds.</snippet>

         <snippet>My Summer of Love, with its lush, sunlit landscapes, may occupy the opposite end of the visual spectrum, but it reinforces the sense that this director knows his way around the range of human emotion as well.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pawlikowski's off-balance compositions and affection for odd close-ups suggest the influence of Wong Kar-Wai, but the film's low-key observational spirit owes as much to Mike Leigh.</snippet>

         <snippet>Some of the metaphors are a bit too literal but the director largely succeeds with his story and the surprises are convincing. Best of all the film has a terrific sense of humor and the young actresses exploit it delightfully.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pawlikowski's heart may be with Mona, but his art is closer to Tamsin. He luxuriates in his sensibility without delivering a movie that pays off in originality or insight.</snippet>
