         <snippet>When you have Bruce Dern and Randy Quaid in a movie, you have expectations. Those two rarely disappoint, and that continues to be the case here.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a fantastic-looking picture in search of a decent script.</snippet>

         <snippet>The middling new Milwaukee, Minnesota, on the other hand, qualifies as 100 percent faux-noir. It recycles much from classic thrillers but has little to add.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Garity's performance doesn't quite redeem this sorely lacking production.</snippet>

         <snippet>More predictable than its makers seem aware, its emotional hooks much too dull to pull us in.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not quite the sum of its occasionally interesting parts. Most of its cast makes strong impressions, but the plot and motivation don't quite jell, resulting in a minor item that shows its star Troy Garity to good advantage.</snippet>

         <snippet>Saddled with an improbable plotline and an incoherent character, Garity demurs on the invitation to overact.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not bad to look at, but consistently unedifying.</snippet>

         <snippet>Maybe if Mindel had focused more on his characters, less on the silly "noir" trickery, his film would do Garity justice. As it is, go find better work, kid.</snippet>

         <snippet>A riot of artfully grungy hotel rooms, sleazy costumes and sordid behavior, Allan Mindel's directing debut gives off the smug air of hipsters at play, making it hard to care what happens to any of its lost souls and inept opportunists.</snippet>
