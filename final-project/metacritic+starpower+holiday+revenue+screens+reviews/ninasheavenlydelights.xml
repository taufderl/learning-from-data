         <snippet>Light and sweet, comfort food dressed up with a dash of exotic spice.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stereotypes abound, dialogue is conventional and pace scattered. Still, resulting stew is pleasant.</snippet>

         <snippet>"A difficult choice, between perfection and heavenly delight," crows the announcer at an Indian-cooking contest during this movie's climax. Sadly, Pratibha Parmar's Nina's Heavenly Delights offers neither.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are a few surprising flavors in Nina's Heavenly Delights, but it's more of a samosa than a meal. The ceiling is set pretty low when characters start exhorting each other to "follow your heart." Which they do, early and often.</snippet>

         <snippet>A lesbian-foodie fairy tale that keeps its appetites well under control. The title may hint at naughty pleasures, but the director, Pratibha Parmar, is more interested in pappadams than passion.</snippet>

         <snippet>This movie's heart is in the right place, which is one way of saying it's terrible.</snippet>

         <snippet>A lightweight and sentimental exercise that succeeds at little except maybe inspiring the viewer to go out and find a decent curry.</snippet>
