         <snippet>If "Wall-E" pushes the boundaries of what can be done in an animated movie, Space Chimps proves that the old formula is still pretty effective when executed well.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kids might find the sight of monkeys -- sorry, apes -- wrestling in outer-space funny, but unless they're unusually sophisticated, much will probably just confuse them.</snippet>

         <snippet>The CG animation is nothing special, but the characters are surprisingly fun and the story is full of enough puns, wordplay and slapstick to elicit laughs from across the age spectrum.</snippet>

         <snippet>Who doesn't love an animated, anthropomorphized-chimpanzee-starring, sci-fi romantic comedy?</snippet>

         <snippet>Why would you take your kids to see Space Chimps, an uninspired animated feature about chimp astronauts, when you could take them instead to see "Wall-E"? And if they've already seen "Wall-E," you're really lowering the bar by venturing into this one.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is suitable for all ages, but there's probably not enough fuel beyond cute chimps in Candyland to achieve orbit for the kids.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kids sense when a movie is being noisy and frantic just to keep them distracted; these apes are overcaffeinated.</snippet>

         <snippet>While candy-colored graphics should dazzle kids, Space Chimps has little draw for audiences spoiled by the Pixar-given knowledge that CGI can entertain -- and not just stupefy -- moviegoers of any age.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sucks a whole lot of talented people into a wormhole of lousy. The film either needed to be a lot wittier to make up for the way it looks, or a lot better-looking to compensate for the funny it isn't.</snippet>

         <snippet>Only a truly dreadful story could make 81 minutes seem like an eternity. And Space Chimps is just that leaden experience.</snippet>

         <snippet>Space Chimps might have been saved, in fact, by using real monkeys in the astronaut roles. Or, better yet, by having a monkey in the director's chair.</snippet>

         <snippet>And then there is the most annoying animated sidekick in a long time: a bulb-headed, trying-to-be-cute glow creature called Kilowatt (Kristen Chenoweth), who sings an ear-piercing, high-pitched note when it's scared, which is often.</snippet>

         <snippet>The animation, incidentally, is half-a--ed, like they ran out of the $292.96 budget halfway through. Rip-off indeed.</snippet>
