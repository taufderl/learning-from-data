         <snippet>Praise be to director Corey Yuen (The Transporter) for delivering one of the year's purest entertainments -- the best butt-kicking PG-13 bikini jiggle fest since the first Charlie's Angels flick.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you only ever see one bad movie about warrior chicks who meet on a tropical isle for a fight contest, make it DOA: Dead or Alive.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sure, the dialogue is absolutely atrocious, the acting sucks, Eric Roberts is a co-star, the action is lame and the fighting is boring. But all of this makes for one hilarious viewing experience. DOA is the sort of film youâ€™ll want to watch with a drunken crowd of your friends.</snippet>

         <snippet>Free of blood, bruises and visible trauma, DOA revels in its fakery. And though the film presents more exuberant female flesh than hiring day at Hooters, it's strictly for titillation.</snippet>

         <snippet>The action has more to do with digital effects than true martial artistry, and is targeted squarely at adolescent boys too young to rent porn and gamers too lazy to yank their own joysticks.</snippet>

         <snippet>So insubstantial that it practically evaporates on screen.</snippet>

         <snippet>"Charlie's Angels," "Survivor," "American Gladiators" and "Girls Gone Wild" are just some of the bad influences on Hong Kong action director Corey Yuen's laughably silly adaptation of the video game DOA: Dead or Alive.</snippet>

         <snippet>A piece of garbage and the best argument for reading books since the first pop-up appeared.</snippet>
