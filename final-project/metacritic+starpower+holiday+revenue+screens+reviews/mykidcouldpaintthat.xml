         <snippet>It is a wonder, marked by a sense of wondrous skepticism that has nothing to do with cynicism.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a dissection of how the media found and fed and nurtured the story in their insatiable need for content to fill their news hours and talk shows, how it just as quickly turned on them and transformed the story from celebration to vilification, and how the public turned right along with them.</snippet>

         <snippet>Amir Bar-Lev's documentary is fascinating on all kinds of levels: as a movie about the nature of art, the lure and pitfalls of celebrity, and the complicated conundrums of parenting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Amir Bar-Lev's engrossing film is as much about the stubborn ambiguities of art, truth, meaning, and relationships as it is about the authenticity of the Olmstead oeuvre.</snippet>

         <snippet>When others can't see what parents see, there's an inescapable ache. As much as anything, My Kid Could Paint That is about that ache.</snippet>

         <snippet>Aside from being a captivating and highly interesting film, Bar-Lev's My Kid Could Paint That is also something extremely rare – a piece of honest journalism.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bar-Lev also explores the freakish popular appeal of child prodigies, the family dynamics that come into play when a child's celebrity and earning capacity overshadows the adults', and the remarkably conflicted and contradictory admissions drawn from Brunelli about Marla's work.</snippet>

         <snippet>Features entertainingly brainy musings from New York Times art critic Michael Kimmelman, and comments from child psychologists, friends and Marla collectors.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a true conundrum: You can't say for sure if a scam is in play or if a genuine genius is being smeared. And the brilliance of the film is that it doesn't let you feel secure in choosing either side.</snippet>

         <snippet>My Kid Could Paint That's about art—and it IS art, among the best documentaries ever made about that elusive process of manufacturing something out of nothing. But it's also a must-see for every single parent who believes their children are special, when all they want to be is your children.</snippet>

         <snippet>The mystery has never been resolved, but to his credit Bar-Lev acknowledges that he himself has become part of the story, torn between sympathy and suspicion.</snippet>

         <snippet>A highly engaging documentary that recounts a remarkable tale. Young Marla is clearly talented, but so too is her father…</snippet>

         <snippet>Documentary gold, and you will have formed an opinion on the controversy by the time you leave the theater. You may not know art, but you'll know what you like.</snippet>

         <snippet>Because Bar-Lev fails to go the extra mile either as a filmmaker or a friend, My Kid Could Paint That is at best "documentary silver."</snippet>

         <snippet>In the last analysis, I guess it all reduces to taste and instinct. Some paintings are good, says me, or says you, and some are bad. Some paintings could be painted by a child, some couldn't be.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film and the controversy should generate interest at the boxoffice, but it's more a story about media manipulation and parental responsibility than art.</snippet>
