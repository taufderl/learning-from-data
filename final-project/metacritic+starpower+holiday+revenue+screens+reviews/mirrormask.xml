         <snippet>This dazzling reverie of a kids-and-adults movie, an unusual collaboration between lord-of-the-cult multimedia artist Dave McKean and king-of-the-comics Neil Gaiman (The Sandman), has something to astonish everyone.</snippet>

         <snippet>If "The Wizard of Oz" were reborn in the 21st century, it might look a lot like MirrorMask. A product of the Jim Henson laboratory, the film is endlessly inventive with creativity to burn.</snippet>

         <snippet>At best, Helena's wiggy adventures recall such Jean Cocteau films as "Orpheus" and "Blood of a Poet." At worst, they resemble the Vegas act of Cirque du Soleil.</snippet>

         <snippet>Episodic, detached, and lacking in drive, but packed with amazing, hallucinatory dream-imagery that makes real dreams look flat by comparison.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie combines drawings, photos, hazy filters, superimpositions and computer effects into a pastiche both beautiful and disturbing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too strange and disjointed to attract much of an audience, but its astonishing visuals showcase a major new talent: first-time feature director and book illustrator Dave McKean.</snippet>

         <snippet>The narrative is simplistic and lacking in energy, and the characters are sketched instead of fully formed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching MirrorMask, I suspected the filmmakers began with a lot of ideas about how the movie should look, but without a clue about pacing, plotting or destination.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like many dreams, you won't remember it when you wake up. The style obliterates any emotional attachment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like the recent Japanese import "Steamboy," this is worth seeing for the artwork alone, but it's so furiously overimagined it may leave you feeling dulled.</snippet>

         <snippet>The teenager's journey through a nightmarish reverie presents hallucinogenic imagery that simultaneously dulls the senses and hot-wires the imagination, but it never fully engages emotionally.</snippet>

         <snippet>Astonishing and frustrating, the fusion of live action and computer animation created by the Jim Henson Company in MirrorMask is an example of too much lavished on too little.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film galumphs along in static panels, prioritizing flash over thought, hyperextending a story that would barely sustain a children's picture book.</snippet>
