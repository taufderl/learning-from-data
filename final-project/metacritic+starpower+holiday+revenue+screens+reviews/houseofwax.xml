         <snippet>This movie gives it to you, as no movie has in some years. Okay, if that's not your part of the swamp, don't go into it.</snippet>

         <snippet>After a month, no one will talk about this movie, ever again. Still, with a picture like this, there's really only one question: Is it any fun?  Yes. Lots. Definitely.</snippet>

         <snippet>House of Wax won't give you nightmares, but it upholds teen horror traditions with flair and energy.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sturdy and cohesive representative of what tends to be a flimsy and tawdry B-movie genre. It even has a moral: People who live in wax houses shouldn't start fires.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sadly, director Jaume Serra has taken the Gothic premise of a madman casting his living victims in wax and, no doubt at the behest of copycat-hungry producers, turned House of Wax into yet another teens-versus-hillbillies slasher flick</snippet>

         <snippet>Like too many horror movies these days, House of Wax goes for scares, but settles for being gory and deeply unpleasant.</snippet>

         <snippet>House of Wax is not a good movie but it is an efficient one, and will deliver most of what anyone attending House of Wax could reasonably expect, assuming it would be unreasonable to expect very much.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a good thing Jaume Serra's House of Wax wasn't shot in 3-D like the original 1953 horror classic - Paris Hilton is in it and she doesn't have a third dimension.</snippet>

         <snippet>The set design is fairly elaborate by the standards of the genre, and the victims don't die in precisely the order you might expect, but everything else goes pretty much according to formula, including a last-minute plot twist that opens the creaky door to a sequel.</snippet>

         <snippet>Acting is similarly routine with the glorious exception of Hilton, who is so bad she steals the show.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is slash and burn strictly by the numbers. There's never an ounce of doubt where the movie's going; the only suspense is how long it's going to take to get there and how high the body count is going to get.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>It delivers some bracingly nasty gore scenes, but there's no spark left in the run-scream-repeat formula, and a movie whose biggest draw is profoundly untalented hotel-fortune heiress Paris Hilton is in desperate need of some juice.</snippet>

         <snippet>Paris Hilton is the big draw in Jaume Collet-Serra's not-really-a-remake horror-slasher thriller House of Wax, and she'd have to be: There's so little else going on in it that you find yourself waiting for her few brief scenes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Related to the 1953 Vincent Price film in name, embalming technique and Warner Bros. pedigree only, the new House of Wax is a dreary, predictable tale.</snippet>
