         <snippet>This contemporary remake of the science-fiction classic knew what it was doing when it cast Keanu Reeves, the movies' greatest stone face since Buster Keaton.</snippet>

         <snippet>Surprise! The remake is not a heresy. It's a decent enough stab at being what the old movie was to its time, following the same basic plot, full of respectful references to its model, updated with a gallery of fairly imaginative special effects.</snippet>

         <snippet>The one unforgivable crime committed in this remake is the lack of the original's most famous line of dialogue: "Klaatu barada nikto." Would it have been so tough to squeeze that in somewhere?</snippet>

         <snippet>I can't explain the film's main problem without giving plot points away; suffice to say that, after decades of watching Earth, Klaatu's team of observers has missed a crucial event you and I witness every day. I can tell you about the secondary problem, though: too much money.</snippet>

         <snippet>Passed my popcorn-movie test. Using the vast, expensive technology of a big studio production, it roused enough cheap energy to drive me to eat a bag of popcorn fit for a circus animal and wash it down with a quart of Diet Coke.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just because the new The Day the Earth Stood Still is green, though, doesn't mean it's dull. If anything, there's a lot more mayhem and destruction this time around.</snippet>

         <snippet>A remake that does not disgrace the original, this is sufficiently different to stand alone and just as relevant in its concerns â€“ as well as succeeding (arguably better) as a thriller. And after this performance, are we sure that Keanu Reeves is really human?</snippet>

         <snippet>For most of the way this ecofriendly fantasy is pleasantly clunky, and Reeves, whose expressive range here is slim to none, is perfectly cast as the alien.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like the big shiny sphere at its center, the film is fairly pretty, but there's no real sense that there's anything inside it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although the new version, which stars Keanu Reeves, is likely to make audiences pine for the meta-irony of "Mystery Science Theater 3000," it's not a complete failure.</snippet>

         <snippet>Keanu Reeves plays Klaatu, confining his usual two-and-a-half-note vocal range to half that.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story, an updated version of the 1951 classic about a portentous extraterrestrial visit, feels musty and derivative, and not only because it's a remake.</snippet>

         <snippet>It lacks the simple elegance and intelligence of the earlier film, and employs special effects and pointless action scenes to replace passages of dialogue.</snippet>

         <snippet>A 'so-so' movie. It's not particularly good, but it's competent and more or less successful in its goals.</snippet>

         <snippet>The opening stretch, when the visitor arrives on earth and blithely dresses down mankind, is great fun. But screenwriter David Scarpi has drained away much of the sentiment.</snippet>

         <snippet>The original Day the Earth Stood Still had a paranoid poetry that lifted the audience up even as it warned the world to come together. This one is so dour it just comes off as a scolding.</snippet>
