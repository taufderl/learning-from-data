         <snippet>More naturalistic -- and as a result, more believable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The greatest romantic movie to jumble its time structure, Stanley Donen's "Two for the Road," is a touchstone that DiPietro must have had in mind. While this low-budget indie doesn't have the gloss or the depth of that romantic classic, the highest compliment I can pay Peter and Vandy is that it belongs in the same company.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie’s saving grace is Weixler, who manages to seem effortlessly natural without resorting to whiny faux naturalism.</snippet>

         <snippet>More a designer frame for actors than nourishing entertainment. Like the Chinese food the leads are always arguing over, the story leaves you hungry for more.</snippet>

         <snippet>You know a low-budget indie has problems when it's less emotionally honest than a studio-backed project like "(500) Days."</snippet>

         <snippet>Peter and Vandy has the decided disadvantage of arriving a couple of months after the similarly structured "(500) Days of Summer," a movie sporting a sunnier sheen, more appealing cast and an actual reason to care about the outcome.</snippet>

         <snippet>An aggravating romance that runs only 78 minutes but ends not a moment too soon.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ritter and Weixler do share an easy-at-being-uneasy chemistry, mostly because his performance is downright distinguished compared to her blandness, but DiPietro's screenplay is emotionally myopic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Peter and Vandy is crippled by DiPietro’s interest in repetition. Activities that were cute and fun at the beginning, we see, ultimately become tedious. The novelty of the film’s gimmick follows suit.</snippet>
