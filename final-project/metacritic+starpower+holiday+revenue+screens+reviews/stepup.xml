         <snippet>Step, under the sure hand of director-choreographer Anne Fletcher, quickly discovers its own virtuoso charms. Two of them are its leads.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alive with infectious rhythm, likable characters, and slick dance moves, Step Up gives clichés a good name.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fresh cast, a formulaic but engaging storyline, and a smoking soundtrack from rap and hip-hop luminaries.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film may not be art, but it's got a beat and you can definitely dance to it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Both Tatum and Dewan know how to move, and their co-stars (including musicians Mario and Drew Sidora) are equally gifted.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie serves up a pleasant, if unsurprising, confluence of classic ballet with street dance, not to mention a seamless collusion of polite racial integration with savvy niche marketing.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story is as old as Mickey Rooney but its appeal is eternal, and Step Up cleaves to the template with significantly more rigor than originality. For a director who is also a choreographer, Anne Fletcher is strangely reluctant to step out of line.</snippet>

         <snippet>Step Up never quite does fly: its dance routines are low-voltage, the star chemistry is weak, the characters are clichés and the movie is practically an instant remake of Dewan's other '06 dance musical, "Take the Lead," which told the story better.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a movie about dancing, Step Up is pretty clumsy on its feet.</snippet>

         <snippet>It really never amounts to more than a barely warmed over rehash of teen dance flick moves.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's no accident that the credits for the movie are a Who's Who of dance movie alumni: Director Anne Fletcher choreographed "Bring It On"; screenwriter Duane Adler penned "Save The Last Dance"; and the movie was photographed by Michael Seresin, who shot "Fame."</snippet>

         <snippet>Tatum, the hunky object of Amanda Bynes's fancy in "She's the Man," and an engaging basketballer in "Coach Carter," is the best thing about this uninspired formula-thon.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once in a great while, a film of insight and wisdom defines a generation. Step Up is not that film. Instead, it's the sort of mildly entertaining movie that comes along a couple of times a year.</snippet>

         <snippet>While its sexy young lead performers and enjoyable dance sequences should provide some boxoffice enticement, this directorial debut from choreographer Anne Fletcher  likely will score bigger on video.</snippet>

         <snippet>The teen dance drama Step Up seems like it was not only inspired by a Janet Jackson video but entirely written during one.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rather than cast actors who can't dance or dancers who can't act, Step Up splits the difference with stars Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, who pull double duty with uninspired competence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Until the movie stumbles under the weight of its noble intentions and its tediously formulaic story, it delivers a few lively, well-shot dance sequences and some winning moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fletcher ably blends ballet and hip-hop, but the filming itself is often clumsy, and Tatum's relentless African American impersonation quickly wears out its welcome.</snippet>

         <snippet>This teen drama may be filled with some great-looking dancing, but its hackneyed, predictable script is a giant step in the wrong direction.</snippet>

         <snippet>This could be a pilot for the WB. Hollywood choreographer Fletcher makes the jump behind the camera but displays a greater aplomb for staging than drama, and the movie is as fleeting as the last weekend of summer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Step Up doesn't want to be new, original, innovative, or fresh, and it makes a point of practicing that guideline at every chance.</snippet>
