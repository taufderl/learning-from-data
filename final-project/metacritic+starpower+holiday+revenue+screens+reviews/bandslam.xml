         <snippet>Had Cameron Crowe and the late John Hughes collaborated on a movie populated by Disney Channel superstars, the result might have looked and sounded a lot like Todd Graff's Bandslam. And that's meant as a compliment.</snippet>

         <snippet>High school musicals have their scrappiest number in Bandslam, an awkward, earnest, almost irresistible indie.</snippet>

         <snippet>the script's earnest intelligence and the actors' charm (Connell, Hudgens and Kudrow are especially fun to watch) make this film an entertaining ode to teenage joie de vivre.</snippet>

         <snippet>Here’s the surprise: Bandslam may come from synthetic materials, but the characters are a little more complicated than usual.</snippet>

         <snippet>Misfit teens in the process of forming a high school band learn life lessons and raise their goblets of rock. But there's enough of a strong filmmaking backbeat in Bandslam to carry the movie's light tune.</snippet>

         <snippet>This isn’t a breakthrough movie, but for what it is, it’s charming, and not any more innocuous than it has to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bandslam is “Camp’’ with rock ’n’ roll instead of show tunes, but its roots go back to the Busby Berkeley backstagers and Mickey-and-Judy let’s-put-on-a-show musicals of the 1930s.</snippet>

         <snippet>The late John Hughes would have liked Bandslam, an upbeat high school musical that plays like a garage-band cover of "The Breakfast Club."</snippet>

         <snippet>Best of all  is newcomer Connell, the kind of charismatic kid who would have been cast in "Freaks and Geeks" ten years ago.</snippet>

         <snippet>Todd Graff's film is written with a desperate cleverness that clamors for attention over the brainless against-the-odds music-competition plot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bandslam belongs to Connell. He has the unruly 'fro and endearing shamblingness of a young Daniel Stern, and he ably brings to life that rarest of cinematic qualities: decency.</snippet>

         <snippet>Throughout its first two acts, Bandslam is charming, sweet, and funny enough to merit inclusion in the upper echelon of teen comedies. Then comes a third act weighed down with arbitrary romantic conflicts, leaden melodrama, and a tiresome subplot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bandslam works best when it's focused on young, adorably neurotic creative types putting on a show.</snippet>

         <snippet>Two incompatible movies duke it out in Bandslam. Although it's the wimpy teen musical that prevails, it's the misfit coming-of-age story that leaves an impression.</snippet>
