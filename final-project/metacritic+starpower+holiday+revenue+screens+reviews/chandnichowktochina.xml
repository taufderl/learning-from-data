         <snippet>Although Americans may be overwhelmed by the dizzy mix of music, dancing, and kung fu, they should have no trouble appreciating the talent of this extraordinary entertainer.</snippet>

         <snippet>More important is to be in a silly mood yourself. Without that - without a complete suspension of disbelief - Chandni Chowk to China is a drag to sit through.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are inventive and engaging moments in this broadly comic action saga. But Chandni is at once enjoyable and maddening.</snippet>

         <snippet>For those with an adventurous and offbeat cinematic appetite, Chandni Chowk to China offers its shares of enjoyments, although there are plenty of "downs" to go along with the "ups."</snippet>

         <snippet>Starts too frantically but settles down to become an enjoyable if slight Saturday-matinee picture.</snippet>

         <snippet>With musical numbers and fight scenes as big as its heart, director Nikhil Advani's action-comedy really does sample it all.</snippet>

         <snippet>A decent sampler for Americans who've never seen a full-out Bollywood musical, since it goes heavy on the action scenes and light on the big dance numbers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its combination of maudlin sincerity, cruel slapstick, exotic romanticism and boogie-down dance sequences may befuddle more than it entertains.</snippet>

         <snippet>It will appeal to the large Indian audiences in North America and to Bollywood fans in general, who will come out wondering why this movie, of all movies, was chosen as Hollywood's first foray into commercial Indian cinema.</snippet>

         <snippet>Of some interest for promoting rapprochement between India and China, this is still awfully silly.</snippet>

         <snippet>At two hours and 34 minutes, CC2C is too much by a half: too much dancing and fighting and too much footage of the Great Wall of China. It does, however, have a vulgar energy and many of the jokes work.</snippet>

         <snippet>A more accurate way to describe it would be "conceptual nightmare"--crass, schizophrenic, culturally insensitive, horribly paced, and shameless in its pandering to the lowest common denominator.</snippet>

         <snippet>As with many a Bollywood epic, you can bring the kids, your lunch, your cell phone, your unfiled taxes. There's so much here, and in such heaping, lengthy portions, you could probably weave a sari before the end credits.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a live-action Looney Tunes cartoon that lasts 154 minutes rather than just five, and it's as exhausting as it sounds.</snippet>

         <snippet>Entertainingly goofy for about 30 minutes. And then, for the next two hours-plus, it's agony.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alas, Chandni Chowk to China, directed by Nikhil Advani, is asymmetrical in the extreme: shapeless, shameless, and slapdash.</snippet>
