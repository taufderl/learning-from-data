         <snippet>This kind of film requires us to be very forgiving, and if we are, it promises to entertain. Angels &amp; Demons succeeds.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plucking the same violent, occult strings as "Da Vinci" while avoiding its leadenness, Angels keeps the action coming for the best part of 139 minutes.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie includes some tony philosophizing about the conflict between science and faith, but it's mostly a beat-the-clock chase through Rome (nicely evoked in Salvatore Totino's lush cinematography).</snippet>

         <snippet>As transparent as this device is, Angels has elemental satisfactions in its blend of movie genre that could appeal to wide segments of the audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>An OK action film, but only the humorless will find it heretical â€“ or educational.</snippet>

         <snippet>A far sight nimbler than its plodding predecessor, where the Holy Grail turns out to be a Holy Girl. The sequel is a little like CSI: Vatican City.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are so many facts presented that many of them feel forced and trivial. We were also a little disappointed with the twist ending.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Less turgid and aggravating than its predecessor, this cleverly produced melodrama remains hamstrung by novelist's Dan Brown's laborious connect-the-dots plotting and the filmmakers' prosaic literal-mindedness in the face of ripe historical antagonisms, mystery and intrigue.</snippet>

         <snippet>Technically a prequel to "Da Vinci" but could also pass for a two-hour episode of "24," rarely stands still long enough for anyone to deliver a monologue.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching what Howard has done with the book - covering up the lewdness, blunting the snobbery, and spackling the amazing plot holes - is dismaying. This adaptation has the stink of superiority about it.</snippet>

         <snippet>At half the length, and with half of Hanks' sneering pretension, this would make a pretty terrific action film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though complete redemption of Brown's fiction may not be possible, Howard's new film at least represents an upgrade from a mortal to a venal movie sin.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps this is what fans want from a movie like this: to sit back as if in a Jacuzzi and get a quick impression of history and Rome and such. If so, Howard, Brown and company likely have another monster hit on their hands.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike Nicolas Cage in "National Treasure," Hanks lacks the game for it. The surface seriousness of these Dan Brown movies obstructs his affability and easy, attentive way with romance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whatever Howard's reasons for keeping things so stale, it was a bad choice, but lucky for viewers, some stories are just too crazy for even the dullest storytelling to completely ruin the fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>Presumably in response to criticism that "The Da Vinci Code" was static and talky, director Ron Howard has made Angels &amp; Demons frantic -- and, well, talky.</snippet>

         <snippet>Angels &amp; Demons is a serious slog. Still, it's an odd kind of a slog that manages to keep you partially engaged, even at its most esoteric or absurd.</snippet>

         <snippet>In its last 20 minutes, Angels does attain the status of good bad movie, with a transcendently absurd climax that's great fun to rehash later over burgers.</snippet>

         <snippet>A shapely, stylish, white-knuckle horror-thriller that hits its marks with blood and thunder. It stinks to heaven, too, but it isn't lame. The streets of Rome haven't run this red since the Inquisition.</snippet>

         <snippet>Of course, the problem with Angels &amp; Demons is that to get to the final 40 minutes, it's necessary to endure the first 90, and that would be defined as cruel and unusual punishment.</snippet>
