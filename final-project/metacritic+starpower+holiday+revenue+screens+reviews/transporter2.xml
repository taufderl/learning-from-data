         <snippet>This ridiculously entertaining sequel is that rare part deux that leaves you hankering for part trois. The action is, in a word, spectacular, but also playful, inventive and witty.</snippet>

         <snippet>In fact the sequel is a better film than the original, as if writer-producer Luc Besson had a clearer idea of what he wanted to do (and didn't want to do).</snippet>

         <snippet>Transporter 2 was directed by Louis Leterrier and he exemplifies a perfect style for this type of film by showing us the action without editing it to bits.</snippet>

         <snippet>It busts the credibility meter early on, quickly becomes preposterous, and then really lets its imagination rip.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stands a triumph of stunts over plot, of style over substance--of the wool we pull over our own eyes. It's brainless, high-speed, popcorn fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>But certainly this is a movie for fans of Willis-style action with a little James Bond and probable instant obsolescence thrown in.</snippet>

         <snippet>Purely shallow but never dull, the film wisely pushes the limits of absurdity to the extreme, making it easier to submit to its sheer camp.</snippet>

         <snippet>Another all-kicking, punching, shooting and exploding dose of Besson born action, and Jason Statham proves that his action mettle in the first instalment was no fluke.</snippet>

         <snippet>The greatest thing about the movie is Statham, a charismatic silent, deadly type who deserves to take the wheel behind a better franchise.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like a cross between "Man on Fire" and "Bad Boys 2," this demolition derby delivers eye-popping action sequences that would make even the Roadrunner roll his eyes in disbelief.</snippet>

         <snippet>The original movie's lean production complemented its pell-mell fights and car chases; here, third-rate CG effects make the strained action sequences look even more improbable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jason Statham is back as the fast-driving, fast-kicking Frank Martin, but this sequel fails to deliver the charm of its predecessor.</snippet>

         <snippet>The only glimmer of actual characterization in the entire film comes – all too briefly – from Frank's old boss Inspector Tarconi (Berléand).</snippet>

         <snippet>If not precisely charismatic, Statham brings authentic athleticism and a certain cheeky presence to his lightly written role.</snippet>

         <snippet>This stripped-down premise made the first "Transporter" fun: It's all about driving skills and choreographed fights, not logic. Even with so few requirements, Transporter 2 runs on empty.</snippet>
