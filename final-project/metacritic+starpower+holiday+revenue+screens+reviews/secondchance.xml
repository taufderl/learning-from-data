         <snippet>Startlingly direct if unavoidably preachy, The Second Chance takes aim at Christianity's racial divide and the corporatization of faith. Its message is simple: being a Christian requires more than just dropping a check in the collection plate every Sunday morning.</snippet>

         <snippet>A movie-of-the-week treatment of race and class, the film credibly portrays the day-to-day workings of an urban ministry.</snippet>

         <snippet>The crisply made feature delivers an involving if not always persuasive portrait of religious leaders in conflict.</snippet>

         <snippet>Competently directed by Christian music producer Steve Taylor, it's a sincerely (if not exactly subtly) performed spiritual drama with a faith-based lesson in humility and the practical charity of offering a helping hand.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a film, it is earnest, cliched, often awkward and unlikely to inspire anyone who isn't already thoroughly sold on its message of salvation through community activism.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its message is sugarcoated in a schmaltzy, clich√©d story line about Smith's conflicts with streetwise black minister (Jeff Obafemi Carr) - and sabotaged by hackneyed dialogue, sluggish pacing and a listless performance by Smith, who only springs to life when he's singing.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are a lot of good messages in The Second Chance about how Christianity is a mix of love, both gentle and tough. Some of those, unfortunately, are lost in the uneven performances.</snippet>
