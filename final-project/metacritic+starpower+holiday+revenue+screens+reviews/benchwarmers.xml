         <snippet>This morphing of "The Bad News Bears" and a "Three Stooges" episode parades its dumbness with such zip that it almost passes for clever.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not terrible, not terrible at all. Yes, the plot is terrible, some of the jokes are terrible, and Rob Schneider's bizarre from-the-neck-up oxblood tan is terrible, but the movie as a whole is a more-than-acceptable addition to the genre of shameless and hastily made American comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>For the first two acts, veteran lowbrow director Dennis Dugan at least keeps The Benchwarmers' pace brisk and the wall-to-wall soundtrack upbeat and infectious. Then the big third-act twist arrives and the film drags to a finish, leaving a slug-like trail of squishy sentimentality.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's hard to buy the movie as an underdog success story, since even the actors barely seem to exert themselves.</snippet>

         <snippet>From the beginning to its very end, The Benchwarmers seems to be struggling to justify its own existence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Under Dennis Dugan's rote direction, Schneider winds up playing straight man to Spade, who once again relies on his snarky coward shtick, and Heder, who comes across like someone doing a bad imitation of ... well, Heder himself in "Napoleon Dynamite."</snippet>

         <snippet>This formulaic mess of sports-movie cliches and self-esteem claptrap contains a couple of funny bits, but you have to slog through a lot of done-to-death bodily function jokes to get to them.</snippet>

         <snippet>An underdog's breakfast of a movie, with some quite funny characters and set pieces mixed with some excruciating "moral lessons," but at least it moves along at a brisk pace.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Benchwarmers is the sort of trash that Hollywood does really well. It is also, to quote Mr. Schneider, "a master's thesis on the form of a quintessential Adam Sandler comedy."</snippet>

         <snippet>You have to credit the filmmakers for at least acknowledging their level of dreck during the final credits, when Lovitz rhetorically asks, "This was a complete waste of time, wasn't it?"</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a movie packed with so many idiot characters that Rob Schneider is cast as the cool guy -- and sort of pulls it off.</snippet>

         <snippet>No laughs here, just the dull ache of seeing Heder slotted into a standard piece of Hollywood twaddle.</snippet>

         <snippet>An unfunny, unfocused sub-SNL baseball comedy that makes the likes of Joe Dirt and Deuce Bigalow seem vintage.</snippet>

         <snippet>The humor is infantile at best (projectile vomiting and bathroom jokes) and meanspirited at worst (midgets and gays, look out).</snippet>

         <snippet>Sandler's latest ode to projectile vomiting, passing gas, gay jokes and physical insults to the groin is basically a feeble cross between "The Revenge of the Nerds" and "The Bad News Bears."</snippet>

         <snippet>Though not entirely incapable of provoking a smile (or two), The Benchwarmers strikes out. Again and again and again.</snippet>
