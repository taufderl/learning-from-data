         <snippet>Strong performances by Scott Mechlowicz as Millman and Nick Nolte as the mysterious mechanic who changes his life ground the film in effective drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is something close to a textbook example of how NOT to visualize spiritual principles of the "be here now" variety.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sometimes in an imperfect movie there is consolation simply in regarding the actors.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cult-favorite director Victor Salva ("Jeepers Creepers" I &amp; II) is a competent visual storyteller and the film believes in itself so strongly (and with such a straight face) that it's hard not to halfway enjoy it.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the ranks of improbable gymnastics coaches, Nick Nolte falls just below the cartoon version of Mr. T.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mere recitation of homilies for better living -- which is what Nick Nolte's gas station guru imparts to a struggling young gymnast -- and a half-baked account of the athlete's comeback are no substitutes for a complete movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Above all, there's Nolte, who hovers over the whole production like some sapient force of nature.</snippet>

         <snippet>All this stuff is probably right. It's just that the director, Victor Salva, underscores his points with thunderous obviousness and manipulates us through ham-handed plot gambits.</snippet>

         <snippet>The "What The Bleep Do We Know?" crowd may well receive the film's wisdom like communion, but the rest of us are free to gag when Salva tries to jam it down our throats.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all its manifest corniness, this is an achingly sincere and supremely unembarrassed effort to transform an audience for the good. Its heart is very much in the right place - a place that movies all but ignore - but its mind is a mush.</snippet>

         <snippet>You'd have to be either an avid New Ager or willing to see Nick Nolte in absolutely anything to get fully onboard for this visually overexcited tale of salvation-by-gas-station-guru.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cast is quite good. But Peaceful Warrior, which is basically "The Karate Kid" with a bigger kid and a bigger mentor, represents a journey of predictability, rather than a destination worth the trouble.</snippet>

         <snippet>The sage-elder/wayward-charge saga Peaceful Warrior aims for inspirational highs but mostly feels like a self-help book read aloud by actors.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of those blessedly rare films based on a self-help book, is remarkable in one sense: It prevents "The Lake House" and its magical mailbox from being the most ridiculous concept on screen this summer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Peaceful Warrior fails pitifully at being transcendent. This New Age movie about living in the moment gets you looking at your watch and squirming in your seat.</snippet>
