         <snippet>Forget Devo, Nico, Bowie, or Beefheart: The most mesmerizing freak show in the history of rock &amp; roll was Klaus Nomi.</snippet>

         <snippet>An absorbing homage to obscure but fascinating late '70s-early '80s German stage artiste Klaus Nomi.</snippet>

         <snippet>Made with considerable wit and style, Horn's thoughtful celebration of the era and its most uncanny diva could function as the show's ("East Village USA") supplement.</snippet>

         <snippet>Horn, who knew Nomi, does an excellent job of evoking the exhilaratingly hedonistic period the film covers as well as the long shadow that the coming of AIDS casts over it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thankfully, The Nomi Song should go a long way toward re-cementing this striking creature's legendary status.</snippet>

         <snippet>Succeeds at its main tasks. It re-creates new wave New York with Proustian force, from the Kiev (the diner) to Fiorucci (the clothing store).</snippet>

         <snippet>With The Nomi Song, Horn does more than simply pay homage to a late artist. He uses his subject to revisit the euphoria of artistic and musical culture at a crossroads, and in the process brings it, briefly and poignantly, back to life again.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film fittingly embraces the elements of camp and kitsch that played such a major role in defining the Nomi persona.</snippet>

         <snippet>Without coming out and saying it, The Nomi Song creates the sense that its subject might simply have been a few hundred years ahead of his time.</snippet>

         <snippet>An affectionate portrait, not only of Nomi, but also of the long-gone days when downtown Manhattan was an affordable enclave for creative misfits.</snippet>
