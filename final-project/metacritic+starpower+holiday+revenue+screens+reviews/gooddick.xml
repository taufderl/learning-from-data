         <snippet>In the vast wasteland of romantic comedies, this lovely film defies the tired genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>Good Dick carries its messed-up, highly improbable premise so lightly and gracefully that it ultimately comes off as a sweet, plausible and curiously grounded love story -- and touchingly old-fashioned.</snippet>

         <snippet>This unlikely micro-budgeted project is written and directed by Marianna Palka, who also plays the female lead. The guy is portrayed by her real-life boyfriend, Jason Ritter (son of the late John). Their performances are quite remarkable and their chemistry is palpable, even if Good Dick is primarily intended for more adventurous moviegoers.</snippet>

         <snippet>At its best, the film is undeniably tender. Sweet, even.</snippet>

         <snippet>Good Dick surmounts its indie-movie quirkiness with exceptional acting and a sincere belief in the salvation of its wounded characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alternately compelling and dramatically limp, the film scores points for exploring unfamiliar territory but lacks the emotional depth to make some very strange behavior believable.</snippet>

         <snippet>An annoying example of self-therapy posing as art.</snippet>

         <snippet>It feels provocative but inconclusive -- brimming with intriguing ideas about love's dark underbelly but not quite confident enough to pull them off.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mainly, Good Dick just proves that TV actors like Ritter make good indie-film hires, because they'll go along with whatever ridiculous nonsense a novice filmmaker concocts.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is crystal clear who screwed up this tortuously slow-moving romantic drama.</snippet>
