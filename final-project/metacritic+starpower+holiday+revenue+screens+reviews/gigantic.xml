         <snippet>The slacker comedy-drama-romance-whatever Gigantic will fulfill all your alterna-movie weirdness requirements.</snippet>

         <snippet>First-time feature director Matt Aselton, who co-wrote the darkly funny, well-observed script with Adam Nagata, has crafted a disarming tale that's one of the better independent films in recent memory.</snippet>

         <snippet>On the basis of Gigantic, Matt Aselton can make a fine and original film. This isn't quite it, but it has moments so good, all you wish for is a second draft.</snippet>

         <snippet>An offbeat romantic comedy that almost - but not quite - works. The characters and situations are a little too quirky for their own good.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gigantic plays like a Sundance movie with half the nouns removed; fetchingly cryptic for a while, it's ultimately just obscure.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its off-center dialogue and upscale industrial settings, Gigantic strains to be original. But beneath its indie affectations it is really another contemplation of generational misunderstanding.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is loads of fun in the early stretch, as the characters are being introduced, but the story never really goes anywhere.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's just not all that interesting to watch two pretty young things go through the muddled rituals of the pas de duh when I can, you know, do it just as poorly myself.</snippet>

         <snippet>We can be grateful to a stellar cast and some discipline on the part of Matt Aselton, a commercials director making his feature debut, that Gigantic doesn't go completely overboard. Nevertheless, the film will appeal mostly to festivals and adventurous audiences.</snippet>

         <snippet>Any resemblance the film bears to real people and real situations is purely coincidental.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dano is a talented actor who needs to aim higher, and it should go without saying that Deschanel can do - and should know - better.</snippet>
