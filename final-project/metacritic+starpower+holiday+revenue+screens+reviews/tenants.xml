         <snippet>Stilted and gloomy as it sounds (and sometimes is), The Tenants gets by on its nimble approximation of Malamud's robust prose, subtle turns of deadpan humor and gut-tingling menace, and remarkable performances. McDermott does credible work here, but Snoop's casting is a stroke of genius.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's something endearingly bookish about a movie whose single most frightening shot involves the possibility of an ax being taken to a typewriter.</snippet>

         <snippet>Harry likes Willie's white girlfriend, played by the Australian actress Rose Byrne with a riveting, sad sexiness. So much screen time is devoted to the men that her part is underwritten, but there are novels in her eyes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Keeps grimly glued to its one-note premise, relieved by nary a glimmer of humor, surprise or personality.</snippet>

         <snippet>Isn't exactly bad and isn't exactly good. It's raw in some places and overcooked in others.</snippet>

         <snippet>The message about race relations in America conveyed by The Tenants, a small, serious, but choppy and psychologically cauterized screen adaptation of Bernard Malamud's 1971 novel, is dire.</snippet>

         <snippet>The stage is set for a full-scale racial conflict, but neither actor is really up to the task - McDermott seems lost in his voluminous beard and Snoop Dogg spits his lines out.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alternately tedious and bombastic, the film never achieves a consistent tone, and the characters and situations, while seemingly played on a realistic level, are neither remotely credible nor satisfyingly surreal.</snippet>
