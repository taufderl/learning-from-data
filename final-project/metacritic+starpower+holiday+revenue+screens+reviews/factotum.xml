         <snippet>Factotum is so sly and low-key hilarious that anybody can be in on the joke.</snippet>

         <snippet>Factotum, for all its grim grind, is funny-serious, and smart-stupid. Just like you after four beers, and me after eight.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like the film itself, Mr. Dillon’s performance works through understatement.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a surprisingly satisfying film, true to Bukowski and itself, a work that manages to make the man and his profane world more palatable without compromising on who he was and what he stood for.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bukowski had a bunch of none too kind things to say about “Barfly" upon its release in the 80s, but, with Factotum, he'd do plenty of bitching and moaning as well, but deep down, Hank would approve.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is also an acidly funny work, even if the humor is that of a man who drinks to stave off the pain and madness of sobriety. In his finest performance since "Drugstore Cowboy," Dillon plays Chinanski with funereal grandiosity.</snippet>

         <snippet>The beautiful joke of Factotum is that Dillon is nobility itself.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film looks great on the screen, and Hamer has commissioned a terrific musical score from Kristin Asbjornsen, who has set a few of Bukowski's poems to haunting, jazzy music.</snippet>

         <snippet>In a medium generally about action and momentum, Factotum is largely concerned with inaction and inertia.</snippet>

         <snippet>Factotum, starring Matt Dillon and Lili Taylor in two of their best film performances, is a good movie about the L.A. underbelly, as recalled by an expert: Charles Bukowski.</snippet>

         <snippet>Each scene stumbles onto a detail of inspired absurdity or a crunchy bite of dialogue that encapsulates Chinaski's weird flavor of self-destruction.</snippet>

         <snippet>The American writer and poet Charles Bukowski is certainly an acquired taste, and Factotum may be just the film for determining whether one wants to acquire it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Matt Dillon is pitch-perfect as Bukowski's alter ego Hank Chinaski.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite some fine black comedy, this hovers uncertainly between the novel's tragic precision and "Barfly's" existential burlesque.</snippet>

         <snippet>After a while, Factotum surrenders to monotony and only the performances are likely to retain the viewer's interest.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bukowski fans - and they are legion - may fill in the blanks from their own knowledge of the writer and find Factotum a more complete character study than it really is. For the rest of us, there are a few laughs - and a corking hangover.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is fragmented and episodic, and many of Bukowski's best bits are oddly truncated.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Arguably one of the best adaptations of Bukowski's work, even compared with Bukowski's own script for 1997's "Barfly," deadpan timing and ace perfs bring out the morose humor and surprising warmth in the often miserabilist scribe's voice.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's too bad that the film was directed by the Norwegian minimalist Bent Hamer (Kitchen Stories), who makes a fetish of building scenes around silence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Embracing such depths, Bukowski somehow made his art. Simulating them, Factotum just makes us queasy.</snippet>
