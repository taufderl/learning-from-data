         <snippet>While it isn't particularly scary or suspenseful, it's fun and surprisingly breezy compared with its big-budget brethren.</snippet>

         <snippet>Adds little to the annals of werewolf lore. But it's briskly paced and features a couple of clever twists on genre conventions.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Canadian-made werewolf thriller, Skinwalkers occasionally rises above its station as a standard-issue horror flick to deliver some enjoyably cheeseball thrills.</snippet>

         <snippet>The only thing more boring than a vampire with moral issues about biting people in the neck is a werewolf who’d rather become fully human than howl at the moon once a month.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plays more like '70s drive-in fare than a monster mash of recent vintage.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a lot that remains unclear about the powers and abilities of the creatures in Skinwalkers, largely robbing the film of tension as events transpire in a slapdash, haphazard manner.</snippet>

         <snippet>It stands alongside this year's other werewolf disaster, "Blood and Chocolate," in illustrating why the moon should set on the werewolf movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching the movie is a little like picking up issue #42 of a comic book after you've skipped the first 41: There's an entire back story mythos hovering in the background like a phantom limb.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>A thoroughly undistinguished addition to a genre that probably reached its peak a quarter-century ago with "An American Werewolf in London."</snippet>

         <snippet>Yawningly directed by Jim Isaac, Skinwalkers is a slavering mess that buries its clunky addiction metaphor beneath a welter of genre clichés, all delivered in extra-slow motion.</snippet>
