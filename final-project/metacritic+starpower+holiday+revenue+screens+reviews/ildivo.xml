         <snippet>An intensely political film so wildly inventive and witty that it will become a touchstone for years to come, Il Divo is a masterpiece for maverick helmer-scribe Paolo Sorrentino.</snippet>

         <snippet>You need know nothing about Italian politics to completely enjoy the fantastical, Fellini-fied, tragi-comic, biographical fun-for-all Il Divo.</snippet>

         <snippet>Simultaneously exhilarating and confounding, dazzling and confusing, this is filmmaking of such verve and style that you likely won't care that you can't follow it completely.</snippet>

         <snippet>The frequently outrageous Il Divo follows the career of one of the best-known and most tenacious figures in Italian political history in a lively, sensory-overload, cartoonlike fashion reminiscent of "Amelie" and "Moulin Rouge." The fact that it's often over-the-top goes with saying, and is part of the fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>The highly stylized, often outrageously funny biopic is anchored by a devastating performance by Toni Servillo as Andreotti, brilliantly capturing the gnomic politician's trademark slouch and inexpressive face.</snippet>

         <snippet>All in all, this phenomenal film illustrates Alexis de Tocqueville's observation that "The people get the government they deserve." In both meanings of the word, Il Divo is sensational.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film proceeds like a black comedy version of "The Godfather," crossed with Oliver Stoneâ€™s "Nixon."</snippet>

         <snippet>Anyone suggesting that an Italian film could rival the style and grandeur of "The Godfather" might end up sleeping with the fishes. But Il Divo delivers.</snippet>

         <snippet>As operatic cinema, it ranks alongside the best of Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola.</snippet>

         <snippet>Il Divo plays like an elegantly ritualized black comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fortunately, there's always the fascination of watching actor Toni Servillo, who does a brilliant job of playing Andreotti (known as Beelzebub) as a kind of devil with a clown's exterior.</snippet>

         <snippet>Il Divo is showboat moviemaking, but the opulence is of a piece with the film's damning assessment of the durable Italian elder statesman Giulio Andreotti.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sorrentino is a spectacularly inventive talent and has harnessed an astounding performance from Servillo.</snippet>

         <snippet>Instead of a modern classic, able to travel the globe with ease, Il Divo is merely a wonderfully cast, tonally assured achievement, with a uniquely strange tour de force at its core.</snippet>

         <snippet>Through Sorrentino's lens, Andreotti's chief lieutenants are made to look like Reservoir Dogs, with Andreotti as a calm, tight-lipped, upper-crust analog to Lawrence Tierney.</snippet>
