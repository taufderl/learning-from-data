         <snippet>Down to the Bone achieves what only the best independent films have: making life, at its most unvarnished, a journey.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is so pitch perfect and realistic, it seems you are there with these people, watching their lives unfold before you as it happens.</snippet>

         <snippet>Writer-director Debra Granik has found a star, and wisely builds every scene around Farmiga's character.</snippet>

         <snippet>If there were an ounce of taste left in Hollywood, the magnificent Vera Farmiga would be a front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar.</snippet>

         <snippet>The kind of movie most independent films strive in vain to be: a small, beautifully faceted gem.</snippet>

         <snippet>Strong performances from Vera Farmiga and Hugh Dillon keep things from becoming overdramatic.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a performance without the histrionics and emotional outbursts that accompany most portrayals of addiction. This feels closer to the truth.</snippet>

         <snippet>First-time feature director's disciplined objectivity is coupled with humanism in this collaboration with a gifted cast and cinematographer. The artistic success, though, may be a bit too cool.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like Catherine Hardwicke's "Thirteen," this film has an ear for the way moms talk to kids, a sensitivity to drug-sweetened intimacies, and an appreciation of the urgent nuance, not just the comedy, of recovery-speak.</snippet>

         <snippet>Farmiga is excellent as a woman who is like the mouse she feeds to her son's pet snake - trapped and about to be eaten alive by ordinary circumstance.</snippet>
