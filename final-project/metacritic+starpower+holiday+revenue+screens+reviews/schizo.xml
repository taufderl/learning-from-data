         <snippet>The brutality of the fights and Schizo's growing ability to outfox his enemies make for a taut and exciting little picture.</snippet>

         <snippet>True to its title, Schizo is both gripped by the past and pulled toward an unknown future.</snippet>

         <snippet>Working from a script cowritten with accomplished Siberian filmmaker Sergey Bodrov, the director creates a taut picture of a place, and a liberating moment of choice.</snippet>

         <snippet>With a cast of mostly non-actors, the film seems rough-hewn, like something you'd find rusted along a road. But it's actually a sophisticated blend of crime thriller, coming-of-age story and social realism.</snippet>

         <snippet>Schizo offers not just the proverbial window into village life in Kazakhstan, but a panoramic view.</snippet>

         <snippet>Schizo is an ugly name for a dark and lovely piece of work, but maybe that's the point. The world this film depicts can be a casually pitiless one, half modern and half tribal, but it can also offer compassion and beauty.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ms. Omarova has a painter's eye for composition and a novelist's sense of character.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a gripping, understated thriller with a solid emotional undercurrent that builds to an unexpectedly moving denouement.</snippet>

         <snippet>If one discounts the facile and unconvincing ending, this first feature by Guka Omarova, offers a convincingly bleak view of how a 15-year-old boy could get ahead in rural Kazakhstan in the early 90s.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it's equally concerned with sensitive young criminals in squalid communities, Schizo is no "City Of God," for better and worse.</snippet>

         <snippet>Schizo is an earnest also-ran, sadly muffled by the opaque performance of non-actor Oldzhas Nusupbayev.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it captures many sharp, stark details of life in poverty-stricken Kazakhstan, Schizo's momentum is so measured, it nearly lulls its audience to sleep.</snippet>

         <snippet>A compelling screenplay, to be certain. But sadly, Omarova's direction is too leisurely to wring any emotional power.</snippet>
