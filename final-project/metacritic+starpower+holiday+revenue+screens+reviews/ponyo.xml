         <snippet>Don't tell Walt Disney, but Hayao Miyazaki really holds the keys to the magic kingdom.</snippet>

         <snippet>Best of all, Ponyo never ceases to be a genuine odyssey in short pants.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s essentially a stroll through a fantastically detailed pastel world, in which the plot is little more than an excuse for Miyazaki to dive into a world teeming with colorful (and sometimes prehistoric) life.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is a word to describe Ponyo, and that word is magical. This poetic, visually breathtaking work by the greatest of all animators has such deep charm that adults and children will both be touched.</snippet>

         <snippet>You'll be planning to see Ponyo twice before you've finished seeing it once. Five minutes into this magical film you'll be making lists of the individuals of every age you can expose to the very special mixture of fantasy and folklore, adventure and affection.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of Miyazaki's most kid-accessible movies, but still an unnerving film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ponyo isn't Hayao Miyazaki's greatest film -- that would be a tall order in a 30-year feature career that includes the Oscar-winning "Spirited Away" -- but his beautiful, quirky fable has magic other children's movies can't touch.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the plot of Ponyo is small as a minnow, its themes--the relationship between parent and child, between the young and the elderly, between friends, between man and nature--are large and fully realized.</snippet>

         <snippet>You watch a Miyazaki film with the pie-eyed, gape-mouthed awe of a child being read the most fantastic story and suddenly transported to places previously beyond the limits of imagination. It's quite a trip.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ponyo is another conceptually and thrilingly original masterstroke from an animator who long ago left Walt Disney in the dust.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even by Miyazaki standards, Ponyo makes less narrative sense than it should, and the pat ending is a bit of a letdown.</snippet>

         <snippet>In short, it's very much a charming kids' film, created by a master of animation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Compared to "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kiki's Delivery Service," this is one of the anime master's weaker efforts.</snippet>

         <snippet>His (Miyazaki) stories, and often his character design, just leave me cold. I know I'm supposed to be magically transported by his fanciful tales and his whimsical grandiosity, but they make me listless.</snippet>
