         <snippet>The movie is the usual kind of film biography of a respected figure from the distant past - honorable, oversimplified, handsome.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the first 10 minutes, I feared the picture would be dull and earnest -- until, about a half-hour later, I realized it was lively and earnest, and also refreshingly, unapologetically movielike.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fortunately, director Michael Apted and his team understand the challenges of this kind of story and have met them with intelligence and energy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike its subject, Amazing Grace won't change the world, but its quasi-religious sense of conviction proves rousing. Apted's unexpected crowd-pleaser is inspirational, but also surprisingly entertaining.</snippet>

         <snippet>Apted delivers a fine, righteous climax and packs his film with some of Britain's best character actors.</snippet>

         <snippet>Apted opts not to show the horrendous cruelty inflicted on thousands upon thousands of captive Africans, shackled and chained, making their way to the Americas in ships. Instead, he has Wilberforce and his fellow abolitionists describe the inhumane conditions - in the precise, passionate language of legislators who believe that human decency is more important than money and power.</snippet>

         <snippet>The dialogue is bright, historically styled yet lithe; the characterizations are graphic even with minor people.</snippet>

         <snippet>Michael Apted's Amazing Grace is a beautifully chiseled blunt instrument. No, it's not subtle, but how subtle was slavery?</snippet>

         <snippet>Picture reflects the no-nonsense storytelling skills of prolific helmer Michael Apted, whose career-long mix of feature and documentary work holds him in good stead once more.</snippet>

         <snippet>Flawed but ambitious, this biopic of British parliamentarian William Wilberforce closely tracks the political maneuvering of the late 18th and early 19th century as reformers campaign to end Britain's participation in the slave trade.</snippet>

         <snippet>The overall effect is part BBC-style biography, part Hollywood-like hagiography, and generally pleasing and often moving, even when the story wobbles off the historical rails or becomes bogged down in dopey romance.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's missing, in the direction no less than the script, is any real sense of dramatic urgency.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's so much story here that the characters don't have quite enough room to breathe, but it's still a fascinating look at a time, and a man, worth remembering.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's earnest, solemn stuff. The movie sings an old tune -- Albert Finney is the blind minister who wrote the title ditty -- and it leaves the blood unstirred.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a doughty movie, stuck halfway between Masterpiece Theatre and Classics Illustrated, but, to his credit, gifted journeyman director Michael Apted understands he's playing the long game.</snippet>

         <snippet>[Apted] also has an unfortunate penchant for bland stateliness, and never more so than in Amazing Grace, a well-intentioned piece of historical waxworks.</snippet>
