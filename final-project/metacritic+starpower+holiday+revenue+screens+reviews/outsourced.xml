         <snippet>Sweet and light. It's a celebration of cultural diversity and an affirmation that, despite differences in race, religion, and societal norms, people are essentially the same.</snippet>

         <snippet>Outsourced is not a great movie, and maybe couldn't be this charming if it was. It is a film bursting with affection for its characters and for India.</snippet>

         <snippet>Outsourced is a sweet, good-natured surprise that takes the cliches out of an overworked genre and makes them seem almost fresh and entirely charming.</snippet>

         <snippet>Josh Hamilton gives a marvelously engaging performance in this fish-out-of-water comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>In its modest way, Outsourced may be unique: a charming culture-clash romance that could be taught in business schools.</snippet>

         <snippet>Simply too bright and pleasant to become a huge hit, but it's a confident little genre film with near-classic charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>This unaffected charmer treats a hot-button contempo issue with old-fashioned grace and benevolent wit, rendering it a sure-fire word-of-mouth crowd-pleaser.</snippet>

         <snippet>Outsourced has all the charm and color of its made-in-India locations, yet it's crafted--well crafted--according to familiar Hollywood convention.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its head may be in the sand, but Outsourced is a good-spirited idyll, an escape from reality, naive to a fault, and all but unconcerned with the troubles of the world but almost -- almost -- convincing in its innocence.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ending is predictable to anybody who's followed the trajectory of outsourcing. Outsourced humanizes those affected by it - even if the story sounds familiar.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is not giving away much to say that everything ends as expected, just not soon enough.</snippet>
