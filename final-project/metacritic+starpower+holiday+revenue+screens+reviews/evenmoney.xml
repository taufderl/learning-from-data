         <snippet>Kim Basinger gives one of her strongest performances in Even Money, a kind of "Crash" fueled by gambling instead of racism.</snippet>

         <snippet>An overstructured, overacted indie drama about gambling, addiction, and the sawdusty romanticism of old-time magicians.</snippet>

         <snippet>As the gambler who needs his basketball phenom brother to shave points, Whitaker has some expressive scenes, and Roth knows how to make malice gleam. But almost nothing else in this movie does.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's subject is not race but gambling, yet the cynical message is the same: We're all pathetic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Standard-issue directorial approach is perfectly in keeping with a script whose natural berth is on the tube.</snippet>

         <snippet>The problem with ensemble films, and this one in particular, is that they often flit instead of float between story arcs. With deep lags in momentum, it is this lack of cohesion that nearly cancels out what can be great about ensemble films: the performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nothing in the movie rings true, least of all its depiction of gambling, both in casinos and in the bookie world that ultimately drives the story.</snippet>

         <snippet>Overlong and overstuffed with cliches -- the movie doesn't seem to realize how close it comes to comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>A scare movie about gambling addiction, is as grim and lurid as any in the recent spate of films about the evils of crystal meth.</snippet>

         <snippet>A high-profile cast can't save this multi-narrative drama about gambling addiction from its wildly uneven tone, which veers from high melodrama to hard-boiled pastiche so overwrought that it's unintentionally funny.</snippet>
