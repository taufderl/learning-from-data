         <snippet>It's not exactly thrilling, and it doesn't cover much new ground. But young audiences will lap it up like ice cream.</snippet>

         <snippet>An enjoyable escapade and a great introduction to the forthcoming series - just not the seventh Star Wars film fans were hoping for.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its simple-goal-driven plot, its wordy, cutscene-like interludes, and its stiffly modeled characters, it wouldn't even make for a particularly high-end videogame.</snippet>

         <snippet>When George Lucas last pulled off an original idea for a feature film, Bill Clinton was still thought of by many voters as overweight and chaste.</snippet>

         <snippet>The best that can be said about the movie is that it's harmless and mostly charmless. The Clone Wars is to Star Wars what karaoke is to pop music.</snippet>

         <snippet>The largely uninspired Clone Wars feels landlocked. In the absence of any extensive innovation, the video game-ready results play more like a feature-length promo for the imminent TV series of the same name than a stand-alone event.</snippet>

         <snippet>Looks fantastic, but the film suffers from the TV-to-feature transition.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Clone Wars is the last nail in a coffin that has been propped up ever since George Lucas sold his creative soul in the quest for a few more pieces of gold.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once again, even reasonably committed fans will need a scorecard to keep track of who's fighting whom. What's the real target audience - i.e. kids - supposed to make of it all?</snippet>

         <snippet>Lucas' films are like Cher's face. No matter how many times you rework the same material, it's never going to be new and fresh again. And so it is with his latest, Star Wars: The Clone Wars.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a mechanical thrill ride, The Clone Wars has an uncluttered look and furious pace that make it more or less as satisfying as its wildly overdesigned predecessors.</snippet>

         <snippet>It might be impressive as a made-for-DVD production, but coming from producer George Lucas, it makes for a cheap excuse for a big-screen spectacle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike its predecessors, this one doesn't even try to aspire to myth. It aspires only to merchandising.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Clone Wars is minor to the point of irrelevance, nothing more than a stylized direct-to-DVD shrug projected onto a big screen while Lucas launches two more TV series filling in prequel blanks better left empty.</snippet>

         <snippet>Don't expect the seventh Star Wars film here. Star Wars: The Clone Wars is more like a long Saturday morning cartoon.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the movie and the accompanying series are being pitched to a younger audience than most new Star Wars ventures, parents may be perturbed by the film's relentless violence.</snippet>

         <snippet>The animated characters in "Clone Wars" are about as lively as the actors in the live-action movies, so I guess Lucas has achieved his goal of eliminating humans from his movies altogether.</snippet>

         <snippet>The whole thing feels like a continuation of Lucas' experiments to see how much sh-- his dwindling supporters will take before finally saying "enough" and moving on to adult pursuits.</snippet>
