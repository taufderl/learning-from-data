         <snippet>A remarkable work -- lively, painful, humorous, deeply revealing of both father and son -- that is worthy of one of Hollywood's finest directors of photography.</snippet>

         <snippet>A superb portrait of a father and son disguised as a docu about Haskell Wexler.</snippet>

         <snippet>Near the beginning of the movie, the younger Wexler admits that the film is his attempt to get closer to his father. This sense of personal mission helps make Tell Them Who You Are the richest documentary of its kind since Terry Zwigoff's "Crumb."</snippet>

         <snippet>What Mark does, better perhaps than either he or his father realizes, is to capture some aspects of a lifelong rivalry that involves love but not much contentment.</snippet>

         <snippet>As fascinating as all the film history is, the movie's core is the dynamic between a famous but distant parent and his child.</snippet>

         <snippet>Possibly without meaning to, the younger Wexler has made a superb examination not of professional cinematography -- really, who cares? -- but of the eternal bad business between fathers and sons.</snippet>

         <snippet>What makes this movie deeply fascinating is the fight Haskell wages. As the semi-willing subject of this movie, he's determined to gain the upper hand or, at least, come out somewhat sympathetic.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The elder Wexler keeps insisting that he won't sign a release for the film unless he approves of the finished product, so he must have been pleased with its brutally honest assessment of him as a gifted filmmaker who never realized his true potential.</snippet>

         <snippet>Chicago-bred Haskell is such an intense, contentious, prickly figure, he would tend to take over any film portrait, and he definitely dominates here.</snippet>

         <snippet>A fascinating glimpse of family love and rivalry, if not a deep-digging documentary of "My Architect" quality.</snippet>

         <snippet>Busting with clips from films Haskell Wexler shot and directed, the doc is a rare thing: an ingenuous portrait of a thoroughly Four-Square Artist, Assembled With Love And Rockets Inside A Family's Spite-Tainted Gates.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the new, personal documentaries in which you pick up a camera to help get a grip on your own life, there is a queasy line between inspiration and therapy. Mark Wexler crosses back and forth over that line.</snippet>

         <snippet>The last word on Haskell Wexler's career hasn't been spoken, but it's hard to imagine there's much more to say about him as a bad dad.</snippet>

         <snippet>A desperately sad look at two men whose determination to rebel against their heritage and succeed in their artform has rendered them unable to communicate. Compelling stuff, though.</snippet>

         <snippet>Haskell comes off as a jerk -- but Mark somehow looks even worse: not just insincere but weak, vain and vindictive.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tell Them Who You Are is indulgent by design, and the elder Wexler may be right about his son's aesthetic failings.</snippet>
