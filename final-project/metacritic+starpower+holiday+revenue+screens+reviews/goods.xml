         <snippet>A cheerfully energetically and very vulgar comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Goods motors along choking out enough lowbrow laughs to make for an agreeably nutty late summer ride.</snippet>

         <snippet>In many places it's genuinely, absurdly funny--crass, sleazy and morally questionable, yes, but still funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sloppy, grimy but quick on its feet, which puts it ahead of certain other (“The Hangover”) R-rated comedies (“The Hangover”) we’ve seen this summer (“The Hangover”).</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie doesn’t even try to break new ground–it’s shot entirely on location in familiar Ferrell-McKay territory.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ed Helms and Ving Rhames score laughs. But the breakout is "Step Brothers'" Kathryn Hahn as the tough (sales)girl who keeps up with the boys.</snippet>

         <snippet>Feels forgettable, even though, in the moment, it's often very funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>A comedy without a shred of obvious filmmaking and an endless stream of good, bad, sometimes terrible, often absurd jokes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although Will Ferrell materializes for a goofball cameo, The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard lacks a key element that his "Talladega Nights" and "Anchor Man" both had - that is, somebody to like.</snippet>

         <snippet>The script by Andy Stock and Rick Stempson (Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach) can, at times, be a nasty piece of work, and no amount of laughter will fully obscure the gag reflex that occasionally forms in the back of your throat.</snippet>

         <snippet>The oh-so-out-there mentality earns some chuckles, but that, along with Piven's preening, gets very trying. A hard sell is still a hard sell.</snippet>

         <snippet>The escapades are tossed off and fall flat, all products of the business-as-usual template created by the film’s producers, Adam McKay and Will Ferrell.</snippet>

         <snippet>The few real laughs -- all two minutes’ worth -- come courtesy of Russ Meyer veteran Charles Napier as Dick Lewiston, the angriest macho male anachronism of the year.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jeremy Piven's infamous "sushi defense" for skipping out on a Broadway role is easier to swallow than his performance as a scuzzy auto liquidator who sees the light in The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard.</snippet>
