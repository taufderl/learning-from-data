         <snippet>In the year of the animated movie, this one soars above them all.</snippet>

         <snippet>Happy Feet is not only the year's best animated movie, it's one of the year's best movies, period. Go.</snippet>

         <snippet>You should see Happy Feet--not only because it's stupendous, but also because it features the best dancing you'll see on the screen this year.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a gorgeously rendered marvel that pulls out all the stops to wow its viewers, but in spite of its crowd-pleasing ploys, it holds onto its integrity with a smart and surprisingly deep story.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's truly surprising about Happy Feet is not its giddily brilliant entertainment, its intimate knowledge of the culture or its toe-tapping music. It's how commonplace these qualities have become in computer-animated movies… Happy Feet may be just one of the crowd, but what a great crowd it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>An animated film that challenges preconceptions about the genre and foregoes the usual romance/adventure structure.</snippet>

         <snippet>Miller's global harmonizing never feels preachy -- he's too busy cramming Happy Feet with enough entertainment for three movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>No film with as many elements as Happy Feet is successful with all of them, and the romantic-emotional elements of this story feel overly familiar. But the music and dancing are fresh and new, and this strong an ecological message has not been seen since Hayao Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke."</snippet>

         <snippet>One of the very best directed animated films on record. Not surprisingly from the force behind the "Babe" movies, the attention to detail is phenomenal, the humor ample.</snippet>

         <snippet>Antarctica is a beautiful blue paradise, and the final set piece, in which penguins and humans tap their way to a unity of green-minded spirit, is a small masterpiece of conciliatory wackiness.</snippet>

         <snippet>A lot of director George Miller's film is gorgeous and exciting. Its craftsmanship and ambition put it a continent ahead of nearly every other animated feature of the last couple of years.</snippet>

         <snippet>Happy Feet ends on an upbeat note with singing and dancing, but the weaknesses that precede it deflate the euphoria.</snippet>

         <snippet>Overall, however, for a children's film, it hits all the major notes. Keep it musical, keep it lively, keep it cute and, you know, if you can, slip in a moral.</snippet>

         <snippet>While compromised by the uplift and affirmation that mainstream animation regurgitates like a mommy penguin, it also shows a remarkable persistence of vision. Even in a story about singing-and-dancing fat and feather, Mr. Miller can’t help but go dark and deep.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, once the "be yourself" story line is resolved (singing and dancing go together, who would have guessed?), the film is only half over.</snippet>

         <snippet>Small kids will love the waddlesome dancing and colourful animation, but older viewers will likely be disturbed by the story’s darker elements.</snippet>

         <snippet>This curious ecological parable was directed by George Miller (Babe: Pig in the City), who still has an eye and a sense of humor but on this particular outing can't get the script he wrote with three others to make much sense.</snippet>
