         <snippet>It overflows with a combustible blend of street sensitivity and testosterone.</snippet>

         <snippet>Edward Norton is in top form as Ray, a burned-out detective whose investigation into the deaths of four cops leads him to suspect his brother-in-law, Officer Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell, also terrific).</snippet>

         <snippet>The stark drama harkens back to Sidney Lumet classics like "Serpico" and "Prince of the City"-filmmaking that went after an unadorned, jagged realism, with acting to match.</snippet>

         <snippet>The final 15 minutes are so awful that it's difficult to believe that the bulk of the film is actually decent.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you enjoy a cop drama, regardless how packed with trite and worn plot points, Pride and Glory should do the trick.</snippet>

         <snippet>What makes the characters in Pride and Glory real -- and raises the movie above the standard corrupt-cop fare -- is their capacity to live and die in shades of gray.</snippet>

         <snippet>At times, Pride and Glory seems to be about a war between actors, not cops. Nobody comes off well.</snippet>

         <snippet>A talented cast and moments of brutal violence can't dislodge a sense of ho-hum predictability in Pride and Glory.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everything in this good-cop/bad-cop action drama is shrouded in gray and attended by wailing. This isn't a feel-good genre, granted, but does it have to feel this bad?</snippet>

         <snippet>It's lifted from pretty much every movie or TV show you've ever seen about police corruption, only not done as well.</snippet>

         <snippet>Feels like a film that should have been made at least 25 years ago. Or made as a period piece. Heavy, doom-laden and, unfortunately, entirely predictable.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>You can feel the debt to Sidney Lumet's '70s studies in police corruption and cop brotherhood, but O'Connor never captures the edge of danger, anger and moral stands being ground up in compromise.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not especially good, but there is enough rough artistry in Mr. O’Connor’s direction to make you wish the film were better.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>A movie full of actors improvising their idea of how cops in a Scorsese flick would talk. It's a special sort of cartoonishness, a hard-to-pin-down brand of emotionally grandstanding fakeness you sometimes see in movies trying way too hard to be "gritty."</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is as histrionic as it is ham-fisted, a bad combination that leads to scenes such as the one in which officers threaten to torture a baby to get their point across.</snippet>

         <snippet>Overshoots the mark by spinning its implausible, hyperviolent tale around too tight a family circle.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a good thing this movie has been sitting on the shelf for a year or more, because, apart from the difference in release dates, there's little to distinguish this new cop drama from last year's cop drama "We Own the Night."</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>There’s something fundamentally unconvincing and contrived about the story. Forget the fact that O’Connor hauls out every cliché in the bad cop handbook and the dialogue is more boilerplate than hard-boiled. The premise itself is just plain preposterous.</snippet>

         <snippet>Edward Norton plays Ray, a (possibly) honest cop wearing an unexplained scar positioned just so on his cheek. It looks like it was bought in the markdown aisle of Halloween Mart on Nov. 1.</snippet>
