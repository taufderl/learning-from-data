         <snippet>Piles on the glam-rock spectacle and coal-black comedy at such a brusque pace that it often seems in danger of rattling off the rails entirely.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not often you come across a film as unique as this, and while my taste for liver, lights, and sweetbreads isn't what it once was, this is still a fine post-Halloween aperitif, with guts to spare.</snippet>

         <snippet>Only time will tell whether REPO! can live up to its cult potential, but the potential is most definitely there.</snippet>

         <snippet>Paris Hilton also turns up, still trying to be famous for more than being famous. She has a ways to go.</snippet>

         <snippet>This would-be cult film is unlikely to inspire "Rocky Horror"-style devotion.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Repo! is obviously no "Zauberflöte," it does offer up spectacle on an operatic scale.</snippet>

         <snippet>Check out the trailer before you commit to this one; if it's for you, you'll know instantly. And if it's not, you'll know that, too.</snippet>

         <snippet>There probably aren't enough futuristic Goth rock musicals, but Repo! The Genetic Opera is weak on a couple of things a musical needs: music and lyrics.</snippet>

         <snippet>The biggest mystery about Repo! The Genetic Opera is why the grisly Goth-horror musical is opening the week after Halloween. The second-biggest mystery is why this unfunny, unscary, preposterous bloodbath about organ transplants is opening at all.</snippet>

         <snippet>So over-the-top it's purple. At the same time, it's not too many lengths of intestine beyond some mainstream movies, "Sweeney Todd" being the most obvious comparison.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is bad -- not good-bad, tacky-bad or fun-bad, just plain awful and nearly unwatchable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The grim finality of the ensuing pietà suggests the last act of Hamlet or, rather, Hamlet 2--so embarrassing that, for the first time, I wanted to avert my eyes from the screen, although that might have also been because Repo! appears to have been shot with a cell phone.</snippet>
