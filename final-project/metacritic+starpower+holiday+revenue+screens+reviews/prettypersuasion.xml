         <snippet>It is also extremely well-written in the fearless way of a smarty pants on a roll in the university cafeteria.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a very funny film about a creepy, excruciatingly lonely world.</snippet>

         <snippet>An obscene, misanthropic go-for-broke satire, Pretty Persuasion is so gleefully nasty that the fact that it was even made and released is astonishing. Much of it is also extremely funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's too bad that the satire is not more pointed, because Pretty Persuasion is outrageously funny in short blasts, mainly thanks to James Woods at his most gleefully depraved.</snippet>

         <snippet>The comedy is brutal and paper thin, but that is less bothersome than the ending of the movie, which abruptly changes its tone.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is such a thoroughgoing nastiness to the plot and dialogue that the film almost achieves a level of buoyancy.</snippet>

         <snippet>A teenie "To Die For" whose flaws are superceded by a complex, compelling turn from Evan Rachel Wood.</snippet>

         <snippet>In a star-making performance, Evan Rachel Wood stars as essentially a younger version of Nicole Kidman's media-age femme fatale from "To Die For," an aspiring 15-year-old actress who hides a sharp, calculating mind behind a façade of vapid, chattering self-absorption.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kills itself with unrestrained negativism, but almost resuscitates itself with some great comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>So exploitative and misogynistic that its last-minute dramatic turns and pleas for tolerance and understanding come off as manipulative as its heroine.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the resulting film doesn't work equally well at all levels, Wood (who starred in "Thirteen") gives an astonishing performance that pushes it most of the way there.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ms. Wood, who made a potent impression two years ago as a naïve adolescent led astray by a sophisticated and psychotic classmate in "Thirteen," has the whip hand this time around -- and she's wonderfully persuasive. She needs a movie to match.</snippet>

         <snippet>So the movie is daring, and well-acted. Yet it isn't very satisfying, because the serious content keeps breaking through the soggy plot intended to contain it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tries to be an audacious, irreverent satire about youth culture like "Lord Love a Duck," but most of the laughs get strangled at birth by the uncertainty of Siega's tone.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pretty Persuasion reminds me of a half-hour TV series that has a great pilot episode, then falls apart in subsequent installments. Movies need to grow and change to keep things interesting; this one is stagnant.</snippet>

         <snippet>A film that aspires to join the company of its predecessors--smart, funny satires that skewered the hypocrisy and cruelty of high school life. But it won't. For starters, Pretty Persuasion commits a fatal error: It forgets to side with the students.</snippet>

         <snippet>A high school send-up more gleefully incorrect than "Heathers" and considerably less articulate than "Election," Pretty Persuasion is a hand grenade lobbed at no place in particular.</snippet>

         <snippet>Another high school vixen movie, this one with a potty mouth (the vixen) and pretensions of social commentary (the movie), Pretty Persuasion brings to mind a number of other titles, all better.</snippet>

         <snippet>Most of Halim's script is a laundry list of offensive remarks that he no doubt means to serve as titillating spoof, but none of it's funny or even the least bit provocative, just offensive.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie wants so badly to be mentioned in the same breath as "Heathers" or "Election" that it's not even funny. Really, I mean it, this charred-black comedy is not even funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's enough estrogen gone awry in this bitchy teen comedy to make "Mean Girls" look like a Disney after-school special.</snippet>

         <snippet>The disingenuous attempt to give the tawdry story some kind of social import only makes the tinny caricatures more insincere, while his erotic display of 15-year-old girls isn't a satire of a sexualized culture, it's just dirty.</snippet>
