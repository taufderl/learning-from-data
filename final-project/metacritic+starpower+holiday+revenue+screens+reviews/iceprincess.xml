         <snippet>This movie is just about perfect for teenagers, and it's a surprise that even their parents are allowed to have minds of their own.</snippet>

         <snippet>But the fine performances of all three leads rise above the cliches, giving the film a sense of reality that both impresses and inspires.</snippet>

         <snippet>A somewhat formulaic if nevertheless crudely effective manipulation of the figure skating themes that all of us girls love so much.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although this is the kind of entertainment designed to send its audience home happy, Ice Princess has its share of stinging moments and has a good deal more edge than one might have expected.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Disney picture should handily score a direct hit to its targeted young female demographic as well as striking a chord with their big sisters, moms and aunts.</snippet>

         <snippet>An unsteady empowerment film for 'tweenage girls and their moms, Ice Princess boasts more spark than sparkle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Parents and kids should be heartened to see a G-rated movie that is not dumbed-down or saccharine-sweet. Rather, it's subtly inspiring.</snippet>

         <snippet>You can feel this niche-marketed tweener fantasy of athletic glory frantically trying to balance a decent sense of values against a market-savvy awareness.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's Joan Cusack as her doting single mom who holds the film together--her sensitive turn as a flawed feminist hints at what she could do with a meatier role.</snippet>

         <snippet>Trachtenberg gives a sweetly compelling performance as Casey, as does the wonderfully kooky Cusack as her mother, but their charms are not enough to save this painfully unoriginal movie from coming out of a triple toe loop and landing flat on its bottom.</snippet>

         <snippet>The most sparkling aspect to Ice Princess is Juliana Cannarozzo, a real-life, nationally ranked skater.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cast, which includes Kim Cattrall (Sex and the City) as a coach who pushes her daughter too hard, is likable and energetic, and the film's messages are entirely reasonable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ice Princess will probably connect most strongly with kids who have yet to develop an awareness of sports- and family-film clich√©s.</snippet>

         <snippet>Joan Cusack and Kim Cattrall bring some nice ambiguity to their thankless roles as the mothers, while pintsize Kirsten Olson and punked-out Julianna Cannarozzo, both professional skaters, leaven this Disney sugarplum with much-needed wit.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's utterly predictable dialogue and plot developments will leave most viewers cold. Ice-struck preteens are, of course, the exceptions.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cusack is excellent as Joan, the only woman in the film who values a girl's brains over her body, so it's a shame Fywell treats her with amused scorn.</snippet>
