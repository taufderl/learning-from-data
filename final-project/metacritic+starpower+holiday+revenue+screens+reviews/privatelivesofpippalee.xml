         <snippet>Flashes of dark humor and steady, grounded performances make it a welcome return for Miller, making her first film since 2005's "The Ballad of Jack and Rose."</snippet>

         <snippet>This is way more than it seems and manages to surprise and enchant throughout.</snippet>

         <snippet>Miller never really fleshes out all of these colorful characters in her emotionally facile script, leaving the heavy lifting to the actors. 
Fortunately for The Private Lives of Pippa Lee, Wright is more than up to the challenge.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wright gives the title character a complexity and emotional shading often missing in this kind of ensemble comedy/drama. Pippa has the feel of a heroine in literature, rather than on the big screen.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rebecca Miller’s fourth film is a wry, acutely observant drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perched uncomfortably between flat whimsy and Lifetime movie crescendos, the coming-of-middle-age comic drama The Private Lives of Pippa Lee is rough going.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, writer-director Rebecca Miller's script tries so hard to be nervous and edgy that it ultimately succeeds only in making its viewers nervous and edgy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The mix is Lifetime soap–meets–Woody Allen smart-set comedy, with less humor and a genteel Connecticut setting.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a movie about the unpredictability of life, Pippa Lee plays it awfully safe.</snippet>

         <snippet>Awkward in ways both intended and not, the fourth feature from author and director Rebecca Miller is an attempt at a comic change of pace for the usually earnest Miller.</snippet>

         <snippet>It almost works. We almost care about her. A whopper of a plot twist late in the game explains Pippa's transformation as some kind of self-flagellatory penance, but by that point it feels like an afterthought.</snippet>

         <snippet>By turns antic, frantic, and dull, "Pippa Lee" is unconvincing – emotionally, dramatically, filmically.</snippet>

         <snippet>In this densely populated ensemble piece, Reeves stands out as the only actor whose damaged character evokes sympathy and avoids cliché. Pippa, played by Wright Penn in near-permanent Stepford Wife mode, isn't much more than a vehicle for false epiphanies and forced rapprochements.</snippet>

         <snippet>Adult children and friends watch nervously as Pippa reclaims a measure of spunk; too bad it all feels like one of those pharmaceutical ads for longer, healthier lifestyles.</snippet>

         <snippet>These actors know how to liven up a room, yet here they're forced to perform in Miller's Theater for the Overwritten.</snippet>
