         <snippet>The result is a feeling of quiet heroism--people doing things because it's right to do them, even if it's not easy.</snippet>

         <snippet>If not for the race sequences and the intriguing presence of Caviezel, who made this film before "The Passion of the Christ" and who one hopes will take on even more roles befitting his peculiar sad-eyed charisma, the film would amount to a well-intentioned snooze.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Madison is earnest and inoffensive, it offers no surprises, few fascinating characters and a hackneyed script.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tends toward the generic, and Jim Caviezel is hopelessly bland in the lead. Among the bright spots are Mary McCormack as the hero's wife and Bruce Dern as the wise old motorboat guru.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wants to be both heartwarming and quirky but is sometimes just cutesy instead.</snippet>

         <snippet>The drama gets stuck in a dispiritingly dull rut and fails to build toward what is supposed to be a something of a crowd-rousing triumph over adversity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director and co-writer William Bindley engages every move in the underdog playbook, including, but not limited to, the time the good citizens of Bedford Falls chipped in to make up George Bailey's shortfall in "It's a Wonderful Life."</snippet>

         <snippet>Benefits from Caviezel's ability to project earnestness better than nearly any actor currently working, but its near-comic predictability, "What else could go wrong?" plotting and clich√©-ridden screenplay sink it.</snippet>
