         <snippet>It's clear right away that The Roost is no hack job. It's made by people who have a major love for the genre and generally anything that goes bump in the night.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Roost advances a nifty man-vs.-nature scenario that harks back to Fessenden's own "Wendigo" and provides a nice chaser to a summer movie season populated by cuddly penguins and benevolent cheetahs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Debuting helmer Ti West taps into the realist-horror spirit of mentor and exec producer Larry Fessenden, and makes a scarier pic than any by his master.</snippet>

         <snippet>Full of genuine scares and impressively disturbing effects.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cynical should be warned that, as in "Blair Witch," most of the scares depend upon sound and editing rather than elaborate effects, but young director Ti West gets a lot of bang for his meager bucks.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ti West's affectionate homage to no-frills fright flicks keeps it simple and succeeds on its own stripped-down terms.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Roost proves that West has enough talent to do without the gimmick next time around.</snippet>

         <snippet>Okay video-dungeon-style horror, a bit marooned on the big-screen but nevertheless murky fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Roost proceeds with such youthful enthusiasm that its rawness is more charming than annoying.</snippet>

         <snippet>Keep your big-budget horror movie expectations locked away in a separate crawl space, because this grainy feature debut from writer-director Ti West demands that you buy into the silliness, and the cheese.</snippet>
