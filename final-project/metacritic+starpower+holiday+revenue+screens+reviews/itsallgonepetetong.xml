         <snippet>The movie catches us up so profoundly in Frankie's self-destructive spiral (and gradual rehab), it's as though weâ€™re seeing it all for the first time. I'd like to say that's because the story is true, only it isn't.</snippet>

         <snippet>The downward arc of the first two acts of the movie is made harrowing and yet perversely amusing by the performance of Paul Kaye.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like "This Is Spinal Tap," It's All Gone Pete Tong should have a long afterlife as a midnight-movie special.</snippet>

         <snippet>A smart albeit uneven jab at everything from the clubbing life to the male inclination toward Peter Pan.</snippet>

         <snippet>The British comic turned actor (Paul Kaye) appears in almost every scene and he carries that weight admirably. He manages the very neat trick of keeping you interested in a character who doesn't merit our affection but earns it nonetheless.</snippet>

         <snippet>Grounded by a gutsy, over-the-edge-and-back performance by Paul Kaye as Frankie, It's All Gone Pete Tong takes the long way around before finally redeeming itself.</snippet>

         <snippet>The only problem is that he's been such a shallow, ridiculous figure that exhuming any real sympathy for the guy is a Herculean task.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lots of Dowse's ideas work well--the ringing tinnitus, the conversion of sound to visible waves, the trimming of treble and bass for underwatery effect, the removal of ambient noise entirely. But as the humor flags, It's All Gone Pete Tong starts to feel more like an exercise.</snippet>

         <snippet>The faux-documentary format does nothing for the material, but Kaye turns in a chaotic and ultimately moving performance.</snippet>

         <snippet>In addition to possessing the most confusing title of the year, Canadian filmmaker Michael Dowse's high-energy dance-club saga It's All Gone Pete Tong arrives in an elaborate package of spoof and deception that should win the admiration of any practical-joke connoisseur.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's part satire of the drug-fuelled clubbing scene, part harrowing disability drama -- and almost entirely improvised.</snippet>
