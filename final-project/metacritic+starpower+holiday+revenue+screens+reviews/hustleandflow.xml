         <snippet>The home-studio recording sequences in Hustle &amp; Flow are funky, rowdy, and indelible. Brewer gives us the pleasure of watching characters create music from the ground up.</snippet>

         <snippet>The performances are accomplished, but the real star of Hustle &amp; Flow is Brewer, a playwright who has written and directed a few other movies but who is effectively making a breathtaking national debut here.</snippet>

         <snippet>In a world of movies that try far too hard to move, entertain and dazzle us, the artistry of Hustle &amp; Flow lies in the way it waits for us to come to it. We can walk as slowly as we want, but sooner or later, it's going to get us.</snippet>

         <snippet>The feel-good movie of the summer. And the song this pimp works up, about how hard it is to manage a stable of ho's, is catchy and moving.</snippet>

         <snippet>Speaks in the raw mumble of the dirty South. A regional film in the truest sense, it does for Memphis what its producer, John Singleton, once did for South Central Los Angeles.</snippet>

         <snippet>I found Hustle &amp; Flow hard to get into at first, if only for its dialogue. But DJay's turf turns out to be everyone's turf -- a jagged landscape of hopes, disappointments, folly and fulfillment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ends with a burst of movie-ish mayhem, and then a burst of sentiment, but when Brewer, Howard, and Ludacris stick to the bitter texture of South Memphis failure and success they produce a modest regional portrait that could become a classic of its kind.</snippet>

         <snippet>Craig Brewer's sweaty, feel-good story about a small-time pimp and dope dealer making one last, desperate grab at his long-deferred dream is driven by longtime supporting player Terrence Howard's subtle, go-for-broke performance as Memphis mack Djay.</snippet>

         <snippet>Howard might be a major actor. His DJay, though, is a major character in search of a major author.</snippet>

         <snippet>Some will find it chicly inspired, recalling blaxploitation's heyday with its grimy urban realism. Some will rightly find it corny, absurd, and an insultingly limited presentation of options for the most disenfranchised African-Americans: I'm still waiting for the movie fantasy about the pimp who wants to get his GED.</snippet>

         <snippet>This disdain for women is not incidental to the film; it is integral to the fantasy Mr. Brewer is selling, which is that pimping is not as hard as it looks.</snippet>

         <snippet>Howard redeems this lumpy fantasy. Soft-spoken and mysterious, he presides over the movie with a dangerous, feline grace.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's something wrong with Hustle. A bad aftertaste, and not just the dry grit of Memphis dust, but something meaner. A feeling that Brewer's sensibility is way off. Aside from Howard's characterization, the most indelible parts of the movie are the demeaning caricatures forced on DJay's women.</snippet>

         <snippet>Spends most of its 114 minutes on the making of a demo tape. People in a studio, rapping and recording. If you're going to watch that, wouldn't you prefer it to be Dr. Dre, or Lil Jon, or whoever, rather than actors pretending to be their kind?</snippet>

         <snippet>But while some may leave the theater tapping their toes and whistling the lyrics to such inimitable original ballads as "Hard for a Pimp" and "Whoop That Trick," they should hang their heads low and mourn the sorry state of the contemporary African-American movie.</snippet>
