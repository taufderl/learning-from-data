         <snippet>An intriguing document, and the first significant film ever made about a former U.S. president.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's galvanizing to see it played out through the furious contradiction of Carter's personality. He is pious, stubborn, compassionate, testy, moral, unreasonable, and wise.</snippet>

         <snippet>The portrait of Carter has been described as hagiography, but it isn't a stretch to view his quiet integrity as saintly next to the track records of his successors.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shows a man whose beliefs, both political and religious, seem to reinvigorate him; he even carries his own luggage in airports and hotels.</snippet>

         <snippet>A documentary that falls somewhere between overlong and compelling as it follows the 39th president on his controversial book tour.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though not exactly a valentine to the octogenarian Nobel Peace Prize winner, the film is a lovingly rendered, candid and intimate portrait.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a remarkably intimate look at the man and his thinking, and you wish for more history to flesh out the biographical aspects of his life.</snippet>

         <snippet>I'm still not quite sure why it's so compelling. I think this movie's appeal is overdetermined, as we used to say in sophomore Marxist-theory class, meaning that it derives from so many sources you can't keep track of them all.</snippet>

         <snippet>These may be the qualities of a great man, but they're not exactly the stuff of a great documentary subject, especially given how hard Carter works to defuse the emotions stirred up by his book.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is no doubting Jonathan Demme's admiration for our 39th President: It's apparent from the opening scenes.</snippet>

         <snippet>The minutiae of Carter's book tour isn't always enthralling, but his personality drives the film: pious, stubborn, devoted to his wife, curious, professional, warm and yet slightly removed from the fray, conciliatory, meticulous, self-effacing, funny, decent, intellectually rigorous and firmly committed to his positions.</snippet>

         <snippet>Man From Plains isn’t about engagement; it’s about disengagement from Mr. Carter’s critics and his more provocative beliefs. It’s also about legacy building.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thanked and vilified from coast to coast, Carter remains steadfast in his belief that Israel's policies in the Occupied Territories are unjust and counterproductive.</snippet>

         <snippet>This narrowly cast documentary focuses so exclusively on a publicity tour the former president took in the closing months of 2006 that a more accurate title might be "Jimmy Carter How I Sold My Book."</snippet>

         <snippet>Carter comes off as compassionate and intelligent. But the complex issues brought up in his book don’t get much more than a superficial debate.</snippet>

         <snippet>Demme's documentary portrait, Jimmy Carter: Man From Plains, has no surfeit of good intentions. In fact, running over two hours, they're nearly suffocating.</snippet>

         <snippet>There isn't enough revealing material in the tedious documentary Jimmy Carter Man From Plains to sustain an 800-word magazine profile, let alone a two-hour film.</snippet>
