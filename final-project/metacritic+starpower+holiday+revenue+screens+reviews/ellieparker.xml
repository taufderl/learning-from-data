         <snippet>Watts and Coffey may have vaulted Hollywood's gated enclaves, but this affectionate film shows they haven't forgotten, nor idealized, their days among the ranks of the struggling and ambitious.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watts is a champ for seeing this through now that she's actually famous.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ellie Parker is at once hilarious and harrowing, and in being so, seems right on target.</snippet>

         <snippet>The sharpest, most authentic portrait of Hollywood life made in the last several years. (As a movie about contemporary Los Angeles, it's approximately 617 percent better than the monumentally bogus "Shopgirl.")</snippet>

         <snippet>A good movie, fearless and true, observant and merciless. Naomi Watts was brave to make it and gifted to make it so well.</snippet>

         <snippet>Coffey, a tart comic mind who should cast his net farther from the 405, pads his story with more and more familiar degradations, and Watts plays each one to the hilt.</snippet>

         <snippet>Welcome to the world of Ellie Parker, a faux-documentary and big, fat raspberry dedicated to L.A.'s underclass.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eventually the energy of the original short runs out and the movie coasts on fumes, but it remains surprisingly enjoyable for all that.</snippet>

         <snippet>A splendid idea for a film goes largely wasted despite a brave performance by Naomi Watts as a struggling actress trying to figure it all out in Hollywood.</snippet>

         <snippet>A clumsy spoof of Hollywood, EP always roots for its hapless heroine. But where this trifle fascinates most is in its connections to David Lynch's masterpiece.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watts is in nearly every frame of the movie, so if you're a fan (and you should be) that's the reason to see this.</snippet>

         <snippet>Without Watts, Scott Coffey's feature-length expansion of his identically titled short wouldn't amount to much.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watts is good -- occasionally very good -- and her willingness to be filmed at unflattering angles, in pore-wallowing or with bright blue ice cream smeared on her face is admirable.</snippet>

         <snippet>It almost seems that Watts made a movie this intentionally scuzzy and low-rent as a severe form of penance to the gods of authenticity for the sin of making millions jet-setting around the world appearing in big, glamorous super-productions. But she goes too far in making the audience suffer as well.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shot on digital video, made on the run whenever Watts was available between gigs, the movie is a pointless, tedious eyesore.</snippet>
