         <snippet>It runs a fast 88 minutes, is broad as the waistlines of its stars, and is remarkably family-friendly if you don't mind bathroom humor.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nostalgia is part of the modest charm of this disposable but inoffensive picture. Old Dogs makes old dogs out of all of us.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too bad this shrilly tuned comedy doesn't demand more than clock-punching effort from everyone involved.</snippet>

         <snippet>Only the irrepressible Luis Guzmán, stuck in a walk-on bit as the stereotypical mooching Hispanic, is able to milk this cash cow and exit with his dignity intact.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is not the Travolta of "Pulp Fiction," nor is it the Williams of "One Hour Photo." Though no animals were harmed in the making of Old Dogs, the lead actors were defanged. But like a pair of Labradors, they have a playful rapport.</snippet>

         <snippet>Old Dogs is so oafish, when it tosses us a biscuit, it feels like we've been smacked with a newspaper.</snippet>

         <snippet>Old Dogs does to the screen what old dogs do to the carpet. It's unfortunate that only the latter can be taken out and shot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Travolta is simply useless in Old Dogs, but Williams is actively offensive.</snippet>

         <snippet>Travolta, who delivers an impressively enthusiastic performance, seems to have no idea that he's stuck in one of the year's worst movies. The perpetually pained expression on Williams' face, however, suggests he knows otherwise.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's wrong with this movie? A better question might be: What's right? Every attempt at comedy is not only obvious but delivered in such a forced manner that any hope of generating laughter dies before the joke has been told.</snippet>

         <snippet>This imbecilic, mean-spirited farce, which sneers at adults, leaves you wondering: where are the Three Stooges when we really need them?</snippet>

         <snippet>Exhausted as the premise already is -- hapless boomer learns that real manhood is a function of committed fatherhood -- Old Dogs nevertheless finds ways to make the lesson even less tolerable.</snippet>
