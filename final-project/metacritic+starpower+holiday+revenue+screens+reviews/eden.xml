         <snippet>This portrait of an imploding marriage is remarkable for every reason that counts in a good film.</snippet>

         <snippet>A picture so modest and minor-key that the emotional bruise it leaves may take days to develop.</snippet>

         <snippet>Well crafted and acted, Declan Recks' Irish domestic drama Eden, adapted from his own play by Eugene O'Brien, offers an intimate portrait of a husband and wife who have stopped communicating with each other.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thrumming with anguish and erotic vitality, Eden paints a heartbreaking portrait of a newly affluent country (freed from dour priests, whiskey-soaked revolutionaries and shawl-clad women) afflicted with emotional growing pains.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eden lacks the technique to give its stifled domestic-erotic feelings their full power.</snippet>

         <snippet>This domestic drama from the producers of "Once" could be about the pair from that gentle romance - a decade later.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Declan Recks underlines every emotion, every brooding pause, working against the spare dialogue with fancy-footwork camera moves and an insistent score.</snippet>

         <snippet>Picture loses its delicate edge when it builds to a prescribed dramatic flashpoint within an overly compressed timeframe</snippet>

         <snippet>An Irish indie that is well-observed and well-acted - but ultimately, not much more exciting than the love lives of its lead characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although its low-key realism is admirable, Eden doesn't really work: the long silences, the aching stares, the telling props, Breda's quivering blues, Billy's drunkenness, his distraction. There might as well be a sign stuck to the Farrells' front door: Dysfunctional family lives here.</snippet>
