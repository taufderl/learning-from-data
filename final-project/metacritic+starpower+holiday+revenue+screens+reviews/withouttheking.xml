         <snippet>The film, fluidly shot by James Adolphus, remains deeply sensitive to the complexities of a culture whose attachment to monarchy contravenes its best interests. This dilemma is gradually becoming clear to Princess Sikhanyiso, the oldest of the king's 22 children and a student in California. Intelligent, articulate, caring and strong-willed, she could be her country's best hope.</snippet>

         <snippet>By far the film's most interesting subject is the king's eldest daughter, 18-year-old Princess Sikhanyiso, who likes to be known as Pashu. She's a self-styled rapper who goes to a Catholic college in California and acts like the spoiled rich kid that she is.</snippet>

         <snippet>A cut above the average Quad-bound video agit-prop doc, Michael Skolnik's Without the King succeeds mostly through negative virtues.</snippet>

         <snippet>With Swaziland providing this mother lode of material, helmer Michael Skolnik extracts only the most pedestrian of films.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is a shame the film doesn't cast a wider net into deeper political waters â€“ the outrage is barely scratched in this production.</snippet>
