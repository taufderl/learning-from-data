         <snippet>The project is not without insights into Hancock's career and musical philosophy and holds moments of inspiration with these stars. Yet the result does feel a bit promotional as the focus is on a particular CD and not on the sum and substance of this keyboard legend's extraordinary career.</snippet>

         <snippet>Filled with great archival footage from throughout Hancock's five-decade career, and with elder-statesman words of wisdom from the man himself, Possibilities celebrates an impulse that's too rare in modern music: the love behind the labor of creation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Hancock, a longtime practitioner of Buddhism who encourages his adoring colleagues to journey beyond their "comfort zones," resulting in some interactions and freestyle jamming that are truly infectious.</snippet>

         <snippet>Possibilities ends up as a testament to only one thing: a missed opportunity to explore one of the most visionary and influential careers in modern music.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film plays like one long commercial. The music's cool, but you're better off buying the CD.</snippet>
