         <snippet>His (Townsend) staging has a tumult, a multi-POV immediacy that brings to mind Paul Greengrass' "Bloody Sunday."</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is not quite a documentary and not quite a drama, but interesting all the same. It uses the approach of Haskell Wexler's "Medium Cool" (1969), but without the same urgency.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's the next best thing to being there, in that it's likely to make shuddering viewers intensely glad that they weren't.</snippet>

         <snippet>While it makes no bones about where its sympathies lie, these fictional stories show a genuine fascination with the role politics plays on both sides of such confrontations and how things can spin out of control with no single person to blame.</snippet>

         <snippet>Is it too much to ask that the fictional scenes have at least some of the complexity and unpredictability of the real-life theater?</snippet>

         <snippet>Picture's ambition, cogency and decent performances make up for its uneven aspects. Woody Harrelson has some especially good moments as a cop.</snippet>

         <snippet>Flapping like a scarecrow in the wind, Battle in Seattle is too frantic to make more than a transitory impression, yet too responsibly hackneyed in its characterizations to achieve pure tabloid hysteria.</snippet>

         <snippet>A drama is only as convincing as its characters. The people awkwardly forced together in Battle in Seattle are rhetorical mouthpieces tied to the sketchy plotlines of a so-so Hollywood ensemble movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>In his directing debut Battle in Seattle, actor Stuart Towns end does an impressive job (on a shoestring budget) of re-creating the massive street protests that forced the cancellation of the World Trade Organization summit in 1999.</snippet>

         <snippet>The chief culprits are Townsend's TV-movie characterizations and a very muddled message.</snippet>

         <snippet>Near the end of the movie, Django jokes that, after the protests, people may still not know what the WTO is, but "they know it's bad." That's a fair summation of how much insight Battle in Seattle provides for its viewers.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Townsend's sincerity, his admiration for the idealism of the people behind the anti-WTO protests, is never in doubt, but combining drama with historical re-creation is frankly a challenge his filmmaking skills are not up to.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a movie by a true believer in anti-globalization, and it may win a few converts, but not among devotees of convincing, capable cinema.</snippet>
