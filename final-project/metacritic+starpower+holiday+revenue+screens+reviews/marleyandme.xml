         <snippet>Wilson has a scene near the end with Marley that's the most wrenchingly tender acting of his career.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's an enjoyable and unpretentious perspective of life that reminds us how important and rewarding the little things can be.</snippet>

         <snippet>And then there's Alan Arkin, who, as John's editor, is hilarious and dry--it's frankly a shame he's not onscreen for every single scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>When Marley is not on the screen, Wilson and Aniston demonstrate why they are gifted comic actors. They have a relationship that's not too sitcomish, not too sentimental, mostly smart and realistic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Marley &amp; Me gets so many of the details right, particularly in its final act, when it turns into a five-hanky weeper.</snippet>

         <snippet>The humans, particularly the wistful Wilson, deadpan Alan Arkin (as Grogan's editor) and Nathan Gamble, a 10-year-old who plays the eldest Grogan child, are very affecting. Aniston, who has great offbeat comic timing, doesn't quite find her rhythm here.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never brilliant but always solid and often wry, Marley &amp; Me is what it celebrates -- an amiable overachiever.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wilson, who has never made the film in which he convincingly played sincere, turns out to be a wise choice to play John Grogan.</snippet>

         <snippet>Marley &amp; Me gets so much surprisingly right. It may be designed to reach a broad audience, but it doesn't pander.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sweet and wise and often laugh-out-loud funny (just like Grogan's book), Marley &amp; Me isn't just for dog people; it's just not for Cruella De Vil.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is torn. It wants to honestly explore the natural wear-and-tear of the Grogan marriage. But it also seems OK with being something that could pass as a midseason replacement on ABC.</snippet>

         <snippet>Owen Wilson manages to break his customary comic relief persona and is adept at playing a little "Father Knows Best"; the yellow lab does a good job too.</snippet>

         <snippet>This perky, episodic film is as broad and obvious as it could be, but delivers on its own terms thanks to sparky chemistry between its sunny blond stars, Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, and the unabashed emotion-milking of the final reel.</snippet>

         <snippet>An imperfect, messy and sometimes trying film that has moments of genuine sweetness and humor sprinkled in between the saccharine and the sadness.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>As a modest little dramedy about the everyday adventures of starting a family, Marley &amp; Me is pretty solid, but as a movie about the joy and heartbreak of owning a dog, it goes straight for the jugular.</snippet>

         <snippet>The end, a drawn-out death scene, is manipulative and, contrary to the movie's feel-good marketing, likely to upset youngsters.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are three fine performances lost in this otherwise middling film. Alan Arkin makes a wonderfully gruff newspaper editor who does just about as much barking as Marley. Jennifer Aniston makes the most of the rather slender figure of Jennifer Grogan, creating a believably human picture of a career woman who gives it up for the kids. And then there's the dog that plays Marley.</snippet>

         <snippet>This love letter to man's best friend will make dog fanciers roll over and do tricks. It's so warmhearted, you'll want to run out and hug the nearest big, sloppy mutt. And while you're watching it, have your handkerchief ready.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not many actors could do justice to the vanilla story presented by Grogan and screenwriters Scott Frank and Don Roos, but Wilson and Aniston â€“ two of the blandest, most uninteresting actors working today â€“ are just the actors to pull it off.</snippet>
