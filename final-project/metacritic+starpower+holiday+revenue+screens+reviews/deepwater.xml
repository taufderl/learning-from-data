         <snippet>The real emotional impact of the film lies in the candid interviews with Crowhurst's wife, Clare, and his son, Simon, both of whom are clearly still haunted by Crowhurst and his fateful voyage.</snippet>

         <snippet>This was a story that made front pages in its day but has been largely lost to history, and now is brought bracingly and compellingly back to life.</snippet>

         <snippet>Disturbing, unnerving and wire-to-wire involving, Deep Water is the story of a dream that got so wildly out of hand that it ensnared the dreamer in an intricate trap of his own devising.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story of Donald Crowhurst is not one of remarkable courage or remarkable endurance. But it is remarkable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Deep Water is a documentary, but it's also one part adventure film, one part Greek tragedy, and one part meditation on the role of the "hero" in modern society.</snippet>

         <snippet>As Crowhurst's situation grows desperate, the scope of the film expands -- from a good yarn to a haunting, complex tale of self-promotion, media madness, self-delusion and, finally, self-destruction.</snippet>

         <snippet>A stunning documentary that not only beautifully elucidates a nearly forgotten incident but touches on crucial themes involving isolation, sanity, self-worth, impossible dreams, the nature of heroism and limits of human endurance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Again and again you want to shout at the screen: “Turn back. All will be forgiven.” This tale of risk, though, ends not with man conquering nature but in calamitous failure.</snippet>

         <snippet>This fine documentary mixes archival footage, interviews with the sailor's family and sponsors, and - most amazingly - excerpts from the film and audiotape diary kept by Crowhurst.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's like watching a slow multi-car pileup on an icy road: Everyone can see what's about to happen, but nobody can stop it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The stories of the other competitors are just as fascinating, particularly that of Bernard Moitessier who, after nearly a year at sea, could not bear to return to England, and turned sail for Tahiti.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even though the subject of this British documentary is a traveller who got lost in a more terrestrial sort of void, the spirit of the stranded astronaut haunts Deep Water.</snippet>

         <snippet>As it explores the limits of human endurance, the pic should suck even landlubbers into a whirlpool of gripping adventure, overblown ambitions and sheer human folly.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is the point -- and the power -- of Deep Water that the vast, unknowable fathoms of the sea are rivaled only by those of the human psyche.</snippet>
