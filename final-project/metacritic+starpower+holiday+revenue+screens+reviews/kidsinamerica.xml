         <snippet>Once in a blue moon a movie escapes the shackles of its genre and does what it really wants to do. Kids in America is a movie like that. It breaks out of Hollywood jail.</snippet>

         <snippet>Overall, though, you get the exhausting feeling that Stolberg is desperately trying to prove how cool he is. And didn't you see enough of that in high school?</snippet>

         <snippet>Nicole Richie loyalists are sure to be confounded (along with the rest of us) by Kids in America, the weirdly anti-Bush high school "satire" that is also Richie's big-screen debut.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has its heart in the right place, but its head seems to be lost in a swirling maelstrom of teen movies that have come before.</snippet>

         <snippet>A trite teen comedy burdened with lofty aspirations of rallying adolescent audiences to political action.</snippet>

         <snippet>Josh Stolberg launches a scalding attack on the stodgy conservatism of the American public school system, only to end up stacking the deck in egregiously smirky and simple-minded ways.</snippet>

         <snippet>Because Kids in America can't decide whether it wants to be a stock teenage comedy or something more, it ends up stranded in the middle of nowhere.</snippet>

         <snippet>Filmmaker Josh Stolberg claims to have been inspired by real-life events, but mostly he ineptly rips off other movies and wastes a cast that includes Rosanna Arquette, Adam Arkin and Elizabeth Perkins.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cast is eclectic and talented, but their roles are two-dimensional and the is-it-or-isn't-it-satirical? tone ensures that their performances never seem properly pitched.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>A comedy so inane and tedious that it buries its premise and its various worthy points under too many arch and improbable shenanigans and endless dialogue, much of it seriously under-inspired.</snippet>

         <snippet>Short on real teenage angst and emotion, the film is long on caricatures.</snippet>
