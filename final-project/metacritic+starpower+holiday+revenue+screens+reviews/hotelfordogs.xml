         <snippet>It's no great shakes as a film, but its combination of mild comedy, slapstick, pathos, many photogenic canines and a positive message will make it irresistible to families.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kids will be as enthralled by this film as you were by the live-action Disney movies of the '70s. It doesn't get any sweeter than a roomful of mattresses with kids and dogs jumping on them.</snippet>

         <snippet>A bright, funny family movie that gets everything right, from story to production design to cast (both human and canine).</snippet>

         <snippet>What it is packed with is lots of sneaking around, very cool gadgets, excellent stunts and some clever kids.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's political and moral points -- and theme about creating family however you can find it -- elevate it above the average kids movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sweet, innocent family movie about stray dogs that seem as well-trained as Olympic champions. Friday, the Jack Russell terrier who's the leader of the pack, does more acting than most of the humans, and doesn't even get billing.</snippet>

         <snippet>On the upside, the movie could do something really positive for the cause of homeless pets: If audiences respond the way they should, dog shelters could be emptied in a week.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whatâ€™s most surprising in Hotel for Dogs, is Don Cheadle co-starring as Bernie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even the youngest viewers, not to mention their parents, will appreciate the buffoonish villainy of the dogcatchers (still useful villains more than half a century after "Lady and the Tramp"), and the movie's nice anti-kill shelter message is as it should be.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's sad to see a promising fantasy turn into yet another industrial-scale fantasy-delivery system that beats up on its audience with mindless intensity and undercuts its own humanity -- and caninity -- in the process.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although you wouldn't want an entire movie devoted to such shenanigans, Hotel for Dogs isn't half as zany as it might have been.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hotel for Dogs is a decent family film, sure to please animal-loving kids and their parents alike. Well-acted, the movie also looks good and is stocked with lots of goofy gadgetry.</snippet>
