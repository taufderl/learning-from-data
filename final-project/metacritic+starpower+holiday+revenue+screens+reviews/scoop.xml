         <snippet>The film is a pleasure that doesn't rank with Allen's best but satisfies far more than most American comedies.</snippet>

         <snippet>No more than a beguiling trifle. But in the dog days of summer, it's a perk to wallow in inspired silliness.</snippet>

         <snippet>The collision of sleek melodrama and old Woody Allen stand-up routines is at times oddly effective and at other times just odd.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Allen's invocation of the "Thin Man" films in an interview makes sense, even if he’s no William Powell and Ms. Johansson is certainly no Myrna Loy.  Scoop was made by someone who understands that what makes the "Thin Man" series enduring isn't whodunit and why, but the way Nick and Nora look at each other as they sip their martinis, Asta nipping at their heels.</snippet>

         <snippet>A light-hearted if ghostly murder mystery that for all the contemporary English locations feels like a 1930s studio film including a plot that bears little scrutiny. Along with the delectable Johansson, the film offers fun roles for Allen, Hugh Jackman and Ian McShane.</snippet>

         <snippet>Johansson is not Allen's new Diane Keaton. She's closer to Mariel Hemingway -- though even Allen couldn't attempt to pull off a romance between his septuagenarian self and a girl in college.</snippet>

         <snippet>After the accomplished smoothness of "Match Point," it's back to more ragged form in Scoop, despite the almost identical posh settings, and the return of Scarlett Johansson as leading lady.</snippet>

         <snippet>To see Allen, now 70, trying to reclaim the persona he's been handing off is
like watching Willie Mays fall down trying to hit a slow curve during his last
season. Woody may go on to direct many great films, but it's time for him to
retire  Alvy Singer.</snippet>

         <snippet>For the first time, Allen's trademark shtick sounds less like the anxious kvetching of an endearingly neurotic New Yorker and more like the ramblings of a tired, elderly man fumbling for the right words.</snippet>

         <snippet>The differences between the two movies are, first, that Scoop is a comedy and, second, unlike "Match Point," it's not very good, as Allen also returns to pre-Match Point mediocre form.</snippet>

         <snippet>As it is, the film perpetually teeters on the edge between a functional vehicle and a train wreck, and whenever Allen opens his mouth, he pushes it violently in the latter direction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Years ago, when Allen's inimitable comedy style still seemed fresh, Scoop may have joined the ranks of "Sleeper" and "Take the Money and Run" as a comedy classic. Today it provides a pleasant diversion.</snippet>

         <snippet>So flat, dull, and off form that it seems to have been conceived in a fog. It not only lacks the verve and energy of Allen's best New York–based work, it feels culturally adrift, like some bewildered tourist trying to read a city map held upside down.</snippet>

         <snippet>At this late stage in a long career, Allen might consider not trying to make films like the early, funny ones. Instead he should aim simply to match "Match Point."</snippet>

         <snippet>What once was a gifted comic's fluid improvisation is now a doddering old man so embarrassing he's uncomfortable to watch, and the surrogate father-daughter needling he has with Johansson is creepy when you realize Woody the director is shooting her seductively in that skintight bathing suit.</snippet>
