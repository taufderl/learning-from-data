         <snippet>The movie is an unblinking look at the hidden (or perhaps not so hidden) pathology of American sports mania.</snippet>

         <snippet>Starring an ideally cast Patton Oswalt in the title role, Big Fan is a poignant, dead-on character study, an examination of a crisis in the life of the most die-hard of die-hard New York Giants football fans.</snippet>

         <snippet>A bleakly funny character study of a very particular species of urban fauna - the sports radio call-in fanatic - Big Fan’ is compulsively watchable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Oswalt sells Auferio's pasty indecision and makes him a more sympathetic figure than he has any right to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>Because the audience isn’t privy to the hero’s thoughts, the final 15 minutes or so of Big Fan are white-knuckle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike "The Wrestler," which Siegel scripted, Big Fan has a way of making a socially marginal figure seem oddly charismatic without stacking the sympathy deck.</snippet>

         <snippet>Comedian Patton Oswalt triumphantly nails every comic and dramatic nuance as Paul Aufiero, a New York Giants obsessive who has long ago moved from fan to fanatic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Siegel, in his debut as director, shot the low-budget Big Fan on a digital camera and achieves an appropriately grimy, gritty look. He has an eye for the telling detail and for the comedy in tragedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Superb Noo Yawk attitude, dialogue and performances (including one from the essential Kevin Corrigan, now well into his second decade of being indie movies' dirtbag on demand) keep the movie lively and tart.</snippet>

         <snippet>Siegel takes us to the brink of operatic melodrama, then lands us in a tragicomic spot: a psychological landscape of alternate life and make-believe death.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the movie isn’t much to look at, he (Siegel) gets a credibly dark and pathetic performance from the typically comic Oswalt.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its unremittingly bleak humor and eagerness to plumb the depths of fanboy abjection, Big Fan seems destined for a future in the cult canon.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's an unsettling, "Taxi Driver"-like character study that shows the underside to hero worship and the primal world of professional football.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a small, peculiar film, one unlikely to appeal much to women, non-sports fans and mainstreamers, but its uncomfortable comic insights should win it a loyal following.</snippet>

         <snippet>Oswalt captures the rabidness of the die-hard fan, the kind you can hear at any moment on the sports talk shows.</snippet>

         <snippet>Comes across as a little uneven, but far from unsatisfactory. Patton Oswalt is sympathetic (at times heart breaking) and makes the film completely worth watching.</snippet>

         <snippet>One thing Siegel got absolutely right in this film is the casting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Siegel's depiction of the film's supporting characters too often borders on caricature. By the movie's strained, overheated climax, it's clear that Siegel, in his directing debut, is less interested in his protagonist as a character capable of transformation than as a human petri dish of futility and pathology.</snippet>

         <snippet>It takes considerable effort to make Darren Aronofsky seem like a model of restraint, but Robert Siegel pulls it off in Big Fan.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The movie gets repetitive, and when it calls an audible and goes somewhere unexpected, it pulls back quickly. Too bad.</snippet>
