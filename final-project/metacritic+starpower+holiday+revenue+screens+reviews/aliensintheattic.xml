         <snippet>The movie is awfully close to a video game with its own specific rules, but its characters are appealing and funny, "Aliens" doesn't have a mechanical feel that drags down most video-game movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perfectly calibrated for the pre-adolescent set, highlighting broad physical comedy and themes of kid empowerment and featuring one of the stars from "High School Musical."</snippet>

         <snippet>A pointless but ultimately harmless family adventure that doesn't mentally assault the 12-and-over set. (Extra points for being 100 percent fart-joke-free).</snippet>

         <snippet>Performances are unremarkable but acceptable pretty much across the board, and the vocal talents -- particularly Thomas Haden Church as the belligerent Tazer and Josh Peck as the lovable Sparks -- are well cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like those mild old Disney comedies of the ’60s and ’70s, it seems perfectly content with being a harmless distraction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Robert Hoffman as the boyfriend, who spends most of his time under the marionettelike control of either the aliens or the human children, provides the film's occasional funny moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>Aliens in the Attic is conveyor-belt family product, an action/adventure/sci-fi/comedy made from the bland corporate DNA of Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. It appears designed for families who never leave the mall.</snippet>

         <snippet>The real problem with this Aliens encounter is that it's patently a Nick at Night midweek movie that inadvertently got greenlighted for a big-screen opening.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cheap, shoddy, crass and depressing fun for the whole family -- by which I mean 8-year-old boys.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nowhere near as bad as "Coneheads," but still isn't worth your time.</snippet>
