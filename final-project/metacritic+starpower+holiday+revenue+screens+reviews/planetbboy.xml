         <snippet>The shows themselves are extraordinary, especially Japan's Ichigei group, which has the all-out fun and athleticism of a vitaminized Twyla Tharp troupe.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's fun about Benson Lee's documentary Planet B-Boy isn't just the amazingly athletic displays of B-boys he puts on screen, but the film's sense of cultural discovery.</snippet>

         <snippet>It looks great and the dancing is the kind of stuff that would upstage the average pop star.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though he doesn't break any new documentary ground, Lee knows how to shoot his subjects. Their stories are moving, and their moves are thrilling.</snippet>

         <snippet>An eye-catching combination of cultural history, performer profiles and competition footage that should see enthusiastic response from niche audiences in urban and specialty venues.</snippet>

         <snippet>It turns out globalization has its good points after all, and they're sporting Chucks, Kangols, and post-Gomi DIY gear. Spin again.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all the energy and personality of its subjects, Planet B-Boy tends to drag, especially toward the competition finals.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lee pays little attention to the roots of breakdancing or how it helped to spread hip-hop worldwide, choosing instead to obsess over the mad skillz of his international subjects.</snippet>

         <snippet>Proves that what might be (but probably isn't) worth five minutes of your time while you're passing through the Times Square subway station really isn't worth a 1 1/2-hour movie.</snippet>
