         <snippet>Buscemi does not act in Lonesome Jim, but his sly humor and keen eye for nuance resonate in every frame. I can't recall having a better time at a movie about depression.</snippet>

         <snippet>With a cast of well-chosen actors, a good script, and an eye for making ordinary suburban scenes visually heartbreaking, director Steve Buscemi's small story of failure, depression-and ultimately, love-in one Indiana town rings painfully true-to-life.</snippet>

         <snippet>In sad-sack movies there is often a helpful woman around to help the despairing heroes. In "Garden State," it was Natalie Portman; in "Elizabethtown," Kirsten Dunst. Both were salvation angels, but Tyler has a gentle approach to this kind of role that is perfect for the tone of Lonesome Jim.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Lonesome Jim feels like it's perpetually on the verge of evaporating, Buscemi brings to the material the boundless empathy for misfits and screw-ups he displayed in "Trees Lounge."</snippet>

         <snippet>Affleck is dead on as the hapless Jim but the film is nearly stolen from him by Mark Boone Jr. who plays Jim's drug induced Uncle Evil. Kevin Corrigan is also great as Jim's brother Tim.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bleak, minimal, bone-dry and hilarious, it creates a rich and layered world from deft strokes of dialogue and action.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a director, Buscemi is drier than he is as a performer: more quietly funny, less intense and sometimes weirdly compassionate.</snippet>

         <snippet>Affleck's gloomy, one-note performance exacerbates the problem, but the stellar supporting cast helps compensate.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a slightness to the mildly eccentric material here that leaves the whole enterprise in danger of fluttering away.</snippet>

         <snippet>The script is adroit: It doesn't force the humor, and it steadily keeps track of Jim's growing maturity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Buscemi shoots with a cloudy, melancholic air that suits the material and does nothing to prettify the setting. But you can't sense any of the surprising energy or subversive wit that characterizes his best performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lonesome Jim has the import of a deliberately squelched sitcom, or a home movie that's poisoned by unhappiness but shown anyway for stray laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>It finds some fine comedic moments when it stops focusing on Affleck's never-ending angst and starts exploring small-town oddness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Buscemi's latest, Lonesome Jim, written by James C. Strouse, asks you to spend 91 minutes with a 30-year-old slacker and would-be writer who has the DNA of a sloth. "Slowsome Jim" is more like it.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of those indie excursions to Loserville that lasts an hour and a half but feels longer than "Roots."</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>At one point screenwriter James C. Strouse name-checks the brilliant Richard Yates, whose fiction similiarly perches between grim humor and utter despair, but the movie's hip detachment is a far cry from the unruly passions of Yates's chronic losers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Buscemi wrote and starred in the small gem of a movie ("Trees Lounge"), which had more psychological nuance than this emotionally cauterized slice of minimalist malaise.</snippet>

         <snippet>First-time screenwriter James C. Strouse (in whose hometown the film was shot) provides so few clues to the source of Jim's malaise, or that of his entire sad-sack family, that the movie remains rudderless and not the least bit believable.</snippet>
