         <snippet>A movie that plays better if you know nothing about it going in.</snippet>

         <snippet>Now, with Seven Pounds, the transformation of Will Smith is complete: Gone is any trace of love-me impishness, replaced by one of the sourest pusses Hollywood has seen since Joaquin Phoenix got his Screen Actors Guild card.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gripping but gap-filled Seven Pounds will have half your brain asking "How could this be?" and the other half saying, "Shut up and go along for the ride!" Listen to the latter voice.</snippet>

         <snippet>Some people will find it emotionally manipulative. Some people like to be emotionally manipulated. I do, when it's done well.</snippet>

         <snippet>A spiritual successor to "The Pursuit of Happyness," but darker and more oblique.</snippet>

         <snippet>While it doesn't break any new ground or provide any revelations, Seven Pounds is unabashedly emotional and cautiously hopeful. It's the feel-good movie for these feel-bad times.</snippet>

         <snippet>Seven Pounds works better the more the viewer feels and the less he/she thinks. On an emotional level, one could decree that the movie is satisfying. On an intellectual level, it's disappointingly shallow.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is pretty unabashed about the all-but-corny sentiment: Each of us has something to give.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's Italian director does achieve in his second American outing a pleasing blend of Hollywood professional sheen and European sensitivity to character details and nuances.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is what lifts Seven Pounds above other Smith dramas -- he does tentatively allow another adult onto his solitary planet.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a con job that feels like a precisely attenuated work of art, elegantly weaving flashbacks and ellipses into the story in an effort to conceal how shamelessly manipulative it is in the end. And as always, Smith comes out a winner.</snippet>

         <snippet>As written, Seven Pounds would have always been a melancholy experience, but a lighter touch would have helped to keep you from noticing the implausibility of its plot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dawson is lovely to watch, and when Smith isn't furrowing his brow and looking concerned, he's not so bad himself.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie gets just enough right that the things it doesn't get right (beyond its overdependence on a not-so-surprising story puzzle) smack you cold in the face.</snippet>

         <snippet>Seven Pounds is one part jigsaw puzzle, one part "The Giving Tree" and both parts marinated in melancholy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Seven Pounds, coming after "The Pursuit of Happyness" and "I Am Legend," seems like the third in a trilogy of inspirational bummers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Saintliness is a heavy burden to carry, and Smith can't help but buckle a bit. He's always interesting to watch, but crafting a real person out of his cardboard character proves an impossible task.</snippet>

         <snippet>A collage of strong scenes, dull bits, good filmmaking and a dissatisfying emotional payoff. A laudable attempt to tackle heavyweight subject-matter that ends up just being heavy weather.</snippet>

         <snippet>Preposterous romantic melodrama, which uses a fractured narrative to cloud an absurd plot that would probably be laughed off the screen if it were presented in a straightforward manner.</snippet>

         <snippet>An endlessly sentimental fable about sacrifice and redemption that aims only at the heart at the expense of the head. Intricately constructed so as to infuriate anyone predominantly guided by rationality and intellect.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Smith's latest film is about nothing less than life and death, sin and atonement, and it takes the soggy cake for multiple layers of sentimentality topped by indigestible grandiosity.</snippet>
