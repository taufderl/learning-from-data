         <snippet>There's still plenty to recommend it, including memorable characters, solid storytelling, and accurate period detail.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everyone's Hero re-creates Depression-era America with surprisingly agreeable anachronistic panache, but a sassy ball and bat don't cut it as compelling cartoon characters, and the not-so-human humans never quite do either (Babe Ruth looks like Shrek).</snippet>

         <snippet>Probably the last movie to carry a credit for the late Christopher Reeve--as well as the last credit for Reeve's late wife, Dana.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sweet, inspirational movie that doesn't offer any surprises, but entertains youthful audiences in a gentle, almost old-fashioned way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Grown-ups, depending on how in touch they are with their inner child, will be split during most of this, inspired to either smile or roll their eyes.</snippet>

         <snippet>The final resolution is silly by just about any standard. A little grounding in reality and a larger effort to avoid the trite could have made Everyone's Hero fun and inspirational for everybody, not just the very young.</snippet>

         <snippet>A strange film, because it seems designed specifically for extremely old moviegoers to see with their great-great-grandchildren.</snippet>

         <snippet>Neither a grand slam nor a strikeout, Everyone's Hero is minor-league animated entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everyone's Hero, a tame CGI cartoon for the simple-minded: the very young, the very old and Yankee fans.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is a feast of miscalculations. It turns out that neither a bat nor a ball make for an enchanting child's companion, lacking as they do the ability to move or express emotion.</snippet>

         <snippet>Some films, like "Shrek," "The Incredibles" and "Finding Nemo," manage to strike the right balance. Others, like Everyone's Hero -- opening today -- do not.</snippet>

         <snippet>Subtle it is not. Well-intentioned it certainly is. No one but the youngest in the family will care very much about it, though. And they may well be filled with wonderment trying to figure out what this big Babe person is all about.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everyone's Hero enters multiplexes already shadowed by tragedy. And while that may not be the best start for a kiddie feature, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve.</snippet>

         <snippet>A tweener but not necessarily a good one. It falls into the gap between good intentions and faulty storytelling.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a shallow, treacly movie for children too little to question its many pointless puerilities. But do kids that young really belong in a theater? Keep 'em at home and wait for this to hit cable.</snippet>
