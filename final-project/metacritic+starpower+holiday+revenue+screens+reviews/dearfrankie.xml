         <snippet>The bold long shot near the end of Dear Frankie allows the film to move straight as an arrow toward its emotional truth, without a single word or plot manipulation to distract us.</snippet>

         <snippet>Material that might have turned to standard dysfunctional family treacle in other hands is given stirring poignancy, warmth and emotional insight in Shona Auerbach's assured first feature.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is a sweet, wonderfully acted cameo of a movie about the lengths to which a lioness will go to protect her cub.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie has been shot with love and wisdom, and its implausible premise doesn't get in the way of a sweetness and honesty too rarely seen.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dear Frankie is a small movie with a big soul and no easy formula for the happiness of its big-hearted characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>But as the story takes some surprising turns, it works like a slow infection: Patient audience members may find themselves awakening to the story in much the same way the characters awaken to their own capacities for tenderness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Doesn't revert to hairpin plot twists or other dramatic trickery to hook us in; Auerbach simply lets us live with her characters-which, it turns out, is reward enough.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The film, with its painterly juxtapositions of dockside industry, green hills, and cloud-scudded sky, is full of misguided motives and fairy-tale fraud. But it rings true at heart.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film tugs at us. And we forgive it its faults because it never loses sight of what it's supposed to be even though the story has a manipulative edge and maneuvers our feelings.</snippet>

         <snippet>Within this overly familiar trope, there's plenty of room for small surprises, not the least of which are delightful, understated performances all around.</snippet>

         <snippet>"Miramax porn." The term refers to manipulative tearjerkers like Dear Frankie whose sensitive performances, along with a light dusting of grit, allow them to be marketed as art films. This one is clever enough to fool a lot of people.</snippet>

         <snippet>On its own terms, Dear Frankie works much better than it really has any right to. Auerbach tells a small, contrived story, but gives it the weight of life.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the film isn’t completely perfect, director and cinematographer Shona Auerbach shows that she’s a great new filmmaking talent.</snippet>

         <snippet>The end result is an unremarkable, unmemorable movie that deserves neither praise nor approbation.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is soft and sticky, but it deserves a (small) audience. If you're in that peculiar kind of blue mood where you'd like to be just a bit bluer, Dear Frankie might be the right choice.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dear Frankie's surprises are few and low-key, but the story wraps up nicely.</snippet>

         <snippet>Happily, the director and writer Andrea Gibb treat little Frankie with as much dramatic respect as the grown-up characters, and he saves the movie from killing sweetness.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie’s glib trafficking in illness, death and pinched little faces to jury-rig our emotional responses (Gibb was inspired by the equally likable, equally pandering Czech film "Kolya") lost me at hello.</snippet>

         <snippet>I’m all for ambiguity, but Dear Frankie’s multiple dangling threads indicate incoherent storytelling, not profundity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Somehow the U.K. film industry can always scrounge enough loose change from the cushions to foot the bill for a pre-chewed lump of sickly saltwater taffy like the mawkish Scottish-seaside postcard Dear Frankie.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Scottish weepie of such bathos and balderdash that it deserves a drinking game in its rotten honor.</snippet>
