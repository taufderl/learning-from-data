         <snippet>Though he tries hard for bravado, hero Edward Burns is terminally wooden.</snippet>

         <snippet>Retro in a refreshing sort of way, a return to those sci-fi films of the 1950s, filled with cheesy special effects and over-the-top acting, but with a gem of an idea at its core, and all done with just enough wit and inventiveness to keep audiences in the cheap seats happy.</snippet>

         <snippet>A guilty pleasure diversion. Yeah, it is dumber than a bag of hair. But it is also fast, occasionally funny and genuinely entertaining in an old-fashion no-brainer manner.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie recovers from a sluggish opening act to pack some real suspense in its second half.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Sound of Thunder may not be a success, but it loves its audience and wants us to have a great time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Summing up, yes, the effects are shockingly bad here, but the real tragedy is that this is a good story that was made into a movie by the wrong people.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ending seems predestined, and the overlong, tepid journey getting to that point isn't worth the price of admission.</snippet>

         <snippet>The barometer of the film's undoing is Burns' super-low-key performance, which starts out as a pokerfaced spoof on heroic cool, but takes a misstep more fatal than mere time travel can undo.</snippet>

         <snippet>Burns doesn't even bother to disguise his New York accent, any more than he does his boredom.</snippet>

         <snippet>The clich√©-laden dialogue, schlocky special effects and predictable plot are derivative; the movie is overwrought and lacks suspense.</snippet>

         <snippet>One redeeming feature of this picture is that it will make great fodder for those make-fun-of-the-movie TV shows.</snippet>

         <snippet>A gloriously lead-footed excursion into time travel with all the accoutrements of 1950s science fiction: an absurd plot, cliched characters, corny effects and a race against time to save mankind.</snippet>

         <snippet>This picture achieves a level of badness that is its own form of sublimity. You almost - please note that I said almost - have to see it to believe it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The picture looks as murky as its story line, the sound is tinny, much of the dialogue is flat or confoundingly technical or merely risible, and most everything on the screen looks patently fake.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is supposedly a big-budget production, though on several occasions the scientist hero (Edward Burns) seems to be walking in place before a rear-projection screen.</snippet>

         <snippet>If 65 million years of evolution have been building up to this movie, then Darwin was wrong. But there's no intelligent design here either.</snippet>
