         <snippet>At its warmhearted center, Beauty Shop is a workshop in how to walk around like Oprah with a feeling of confidence and entitlement.</snippet>

         <snippet>Beauty Shop extends the popular "Barbershop" franchise to Atlanta and provides a sassy feminine counterpart to its cozy men's-club vibe.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all the vivid, amusing characters that surround Gina, Beauty Shop rightly belongs to Latifah, who comes into her own as a star and an actress in this film.</snippet>

         <snippet>The plot progression can be guessed early on, but the film is more about humor and heart than a clever story.</snippet>

         <snippet>As in the other two movies, the plot is a thin cardboard box used to carry an assortment of observational doughnuts--in this case, estrogen-fueled shop talk about race, men, and the politics of looking good.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a boisterous and amiable movie but not, in the end, a very funny one.</snippet>

         <snippet>Spends too much time being convivial and not enough time looking for the kind of real conflict that begets a good comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mildly amusing and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, with much of its humor playing off foolish white folks and gay stereotypes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plays like a pilot for a TV sitcom. It sets up enough story threads for an entire season yet nothing much actually happens during the 105-minute running time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Beauty Shop's shtick gets old and tired pretty quickly, but a breezy tone and air of easygoing likeability carry it a long way.</snippet>

         <snippet>A spin-off of a sequel... It doesn't even try to be different, because it assumes the moviegoer wants only the same-ol' and then offers even less.</snippet>

         <snippet>The residents of Beauty Shop never quite gel. Instead of camaraderie, the feeling is one of bare tolerance.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The script is painfully underbaked, and director Bille Woodruff (Honey) continues to raise a question: How can someone from a music-video background have absolutely no sense of rhythm, timing or pacing?</snippet>
