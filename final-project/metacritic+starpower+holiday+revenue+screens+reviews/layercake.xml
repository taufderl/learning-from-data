         <snippet>Craig is fascinating here as a criminal who is very smart, and finds that is not an advantage because while you might be able to figure out what another smart person is about to do, dumbos like the men he works for are likely to do anything.</snippet>

         <snippet>Laced with flashbacks and stylistic tics, but it never loses its forward momentum, and to the last shot, it avoids predictability.</snippet>

         <snippet>The always-dependable and chameleon-like Craig has the chops and substance for that kind of film, but Vaughn prefers to keep matters brisk and superficial.</snippet>
