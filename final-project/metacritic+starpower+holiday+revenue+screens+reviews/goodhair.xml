         <snippet>Good Hair is cause for hope that Rock continues to make documentaries. His style is lively, smooth and up-to-date, like the most coveted 'do.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rock gives Good Hair a rousing message: Where African-Americans in the '60s adopted a ''natural'' look, they now feel free to coif their heads any way they want. That's cultural power.</snippet>

         <snippet>Is it possible to talk about the fascinating and complex universe of black hair without dealing with race and identity? That’s the question posed by Good Hair.</snippet>

         <snippet>Spirited, probing and frequently hilarious, it coasts on the fearless charm of its front man and the eye-opening candor of its interviewees, most of them women.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of those rare documentaries that works on two seemingly incongruous levels at once: It's both social commentary and pure delight.</snippet>

         <snippet>A raucous and rigorous inquiry into the subject of African-American hair -- the stigmas, the secrets, the shocking price of maintenance -- that gets at universal but rarely discussed truths about black femininity.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a documentary that weaves as much comedy as fact into the narrative, making the experience a satisfying entertainment even for the lucky few who have no hair cares at all.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thanks to Rock's running monologue, combining scathing humor with trenchant observations, the film manages to be side-splitting even while making its most poignant points.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rock misses the boat in deciding not to relate Good Hair to non African-Americans more.</snippet>

         <snippet>"Our self-esteem is wrapped up in it,'' admits actress Tracie Thoms (who sticks with a natural curly look). "A woman's hair is her glory,'' Angelou says.</snippet>

         <snippet>There’s a lot of Michael Moore’s ambulatory spirit in this film, which the comedian Jeff Stinson directed. There’s also a lot of the damning comedic commentary that made Rock’s old HBO series so urgent.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s an eye-opening and modestly funny look at a massive business and a culture with its own signifiers and language.</snippet>

         <snippet>About the only question not answered by Good Hair is whether Michelle Obama wears a hair extension (most come from religious ceremonies in India) or straightens her hair.</snippet>

         <snippet>Good Hair is also about how African-Americans spend $9-billion annually chemically treating and straightening their hair, buying 80 per cent of America's hair products. It's such a fascinating, complex tale that you hope one day some probing filmmaker will make a conclusive documentary on the subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rock conveys a lot of information, but also some unfortunate opinions and misleading facts. That doesn't mean the move isn't warm, funny, and entertaining.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rock  takes his Good Hair job as a documentarian seriously enough to be interesting, but not so seriously that the film groans with earnestness.</snippet>

         <snippet>In addition to the socio-economic impact, Good Hair also explores how hair care affects the African-American community in confidence (both personal and race-related), romantic relationships and every day life.</snippet>
