         <snippet>A lumpy admixture of politics and carnality, but when it all comes together, it has a lingering force.</snippet>

         <snippet>The performances by neophite actresses Olympe Borval and Lizzie Brochere make the film special.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has a sensuous, intimate filmmaking style that overrides The Wedding Song's more precariously loaded plot parallels.</snippet>

         <snippet>A seductively fluid and tactile drama from the writer and director Karin Albou, explores love and identity through the prism of the female body and the rights of its owner.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's distinction, however, lies in two lovely performances, and in the passion and pain of parallel lives--both girls suffering at the hands of men, both struggling to understand the brutality of the world they must share.</snippet>

         <snippet>Albouâ€™s film conjures an irresistibly evocative atmosphere of stifling limitations, as well as a frank view of the female body that vacillates between carnal, sacrificial and beatific. Its caustic beauty is hard to shake.</snippet>

         <snippet>It takes more than just the ominous tread of Nazi boots to infuse gravitas into this well-intentioned but dreary look at the female mind and body during wartime.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though lovely to look at, The Wedding Song is a little overwhelmed by its relentlessly hyper-poetic imagery.</snippet>
