         <snippet>In its design, at least, Mindhunters"surpasses all other Christie knockoffs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Trashy and indefensible in most respects, Mindhunters may be a good-bad movie, but entertainment is entertainment, however it comes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Renny Harlin's take on Agatha Christie's versatile "Ten Little Indians" is total B-movie swagger in all its unsubtle glory.</snippet>

         <snippet>Is the film worth seeing? Well, yes and no. Yes, because it is exactly what it is, and no, for the same reason.</snippet>

         <snippet>What does satisfy is the pleasantly becalming presence of "Deep" costar LL Cool J. He's fast becoming Liv Ullmann to Harlin's Bergman.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of Mindhunters' strengths is that it's difficult to guess who the culprit is because Harlin and his screenwriters don't play fair with the audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>The score sucks and the acting is weak, but there are times when certain moviegoers just feel the need to stare far-fetched, blood-drenched death in the eye and laugh. It's here, so have at it.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Mindhunters aspires to be a psychological thriller, it's really just mindless entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Here's a film that exhibits all kinds of joy in uncoiling a story with no ending, or an ending that's so arbitrary you get the feeling that the filmmakers just threw names in a hat to see who their killer would be.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's been fascinating to watch the "intellectual" subgenre of the serial-killer movie -- the one where poetic evil geniuses elude the cops while leaving trails of art-directed crime scenes -- run out of ideas and start feeding on itself.</snippet>

         <snippet>A tiring exercise in time-biding sadism (versus wit or suspense), inflated with shock editing, noisy effects and an angry score, like a thriller with road rage.</snippet>

         <snippet>Turns out to be a thudding dud, crammed with clunky dialogue, bad acting and gruesome but unpersuasive gore. Mindhunters will pass muster with only the most undemanding horror fans.</snippet>

         <snippet>In 1939, when "Ten Little Indians" was published, Agatha Christie mysteries were the cr√®me de la pop literature. Her fans depended on logic in her stories, and they got it. Mindhunters would have insulted their intelligence, and it should insult yours.</snippet>
