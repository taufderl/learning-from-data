         <snippet>It's difficult at first to tell whether this is a documentary or a fictional work and this makes Assisted Living all the more involving.</snippet>

         <snippet>This finale turns Assisted Living from fascinating experimental film into something finer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Somehow, Assisted Living jells. Maggie Riley is astoundingly convincing, and she and Bonsignore's Todd have an unforced chemistry that catches you off guard.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gently filmed, quietly thoughtful, sometimes almost heartbreaking.</snippet>

         <snippet>May be a comedy, but its images of physical frailty are inescapably unsettling. As the camera fixates on frail, spotted trembling hands unsteadily reaching out, it is impossible not to imagine a future in which those hands could be yours.</snippet>

         <snippet>Greenebaum manages to portray old-age as a condition with its own peculiar beauty and considerable grace.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yet for all its willful blurring of the lines between documentary and fiction, Assisted Living is the least self-conscious of movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Only 22 when he began shooting the film, Greenebaum displays a prodigious understanding of the treatment of the elderly in contemporary America.</snippet>

         <snippet>The whimsy Greenebaum wants to construct can't match the terminal sadness that naturally takes over the film. Perhaps in accidental tribute to Todd, the whole thing feels half-baked.</snippet>

         <snippet>Assisted Living's overall mix doesn't quite jell, though there are worthwhile moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>A curious film with real heart but questionable technique. This art house fodder is just quirky and fresh enough to catch on with audiences.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a finer line between peaceable pothead jocularity and just being a dick--and sometimes it's tough to tell whether Todd is more Jon Stewart or Tucker Carlson.</snippet>

         <snippet>Assisted Living gets a little better as it wears on, and at least it's refreshingly short.</snippet>

         <snippet>The occasionally contrived music-video slicky edge, and the fact that there's no way on God's green earth that what takes place in Assisted Living happens in one day, it's a noble effort.</snippet>

         <snippet>Parts of the film play like the world's slowest and most insensitive reality show (Who Wants to Be an Octogenarian?).</snippet>
