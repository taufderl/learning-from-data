         <snippet>Like mother, like daughter best sums up Or (My Treasure), a raw drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yedaya is respectful and sensitive of everyone in Or's life and creates a beautiful, complex and rich relationship between mother and daughter, loving and protective of each other, but not of themselves.</snippet>

         <snippet>Consistently engaging, non-judgmental and cumulatively powerful two-hander marks a noteworthy feature debut for Israeli helmer Keren Yedaya.</snippet>

         <snippet>Israeli director Keren Yedaya's remarkable debut feature, which won the 2004 Cannes Film Festival Camera d'Or, is a powerful study of a teenager's willingness to do anything to save her mother, a Tel Aviv prostitute who may be well beyond salvation.</snippet>

         <snippet>For long stretches, Or is a dialogue-heavy kitchen-sink drama, but its naturalistic style and unselfconscious performances give it an intensity that only builds as it progresses.</snippet>

         <snippet>Insofar as they're implicitly the spoils of war, this movie seems to be meditating on the whys and hows of the spoiling process -- raising more questions than can possibly be answered, and in this sense, at least, far from dogmatic.</snippet>

         <snippet>A work of exceptional subtlety and is all the more captivating and heart-rending for being so.</snippet>

         <snippet>The scoreless Or (My Treasure) consists solely of stationary shots that, while sometimes awkwardly composed, build in organic momentum and bracing detail.</snippet>

         <snippet>This well-meaning but irritatingly na√Øve feature delves into the horrors of prostitution, or more accurately, the filmmaker's horror about the subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>Suffers from long takes, no music score, naturalistic acting and an agenda so stifling it doesn't allow its characters to breathe.</snippet>

         <snippet>Doggedly refusing artifice as if cinematic beauty were a filthy capitalist plot, Yedaya drowns her characters in realist grit, a colorless screenplay and no score to speak of, rendering this open book of a movie alienating in all the wrong ways.</snippet>
