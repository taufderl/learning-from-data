         <snippet>It's probably the impresario's best-made movie yet, his most joyful, and his most moving.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s the best Tyler Perry movie to date - the writer/director/actor/mogul’s most confident and competent mixture of uplifting black middle-class melodrama and low-down comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>A double shot of Saturday-night lowdown chased by a cheery chug of Sunday-morning uplift.</snippet>

         <snippet>What works best, though, is that it's practically an R&amp;B/gospel musical.</snippet>

         <snippet>With Bad, Perry is savvy enough to let riveting musical numbers by ringers like Gladys Knight and Mary J. Blige--along with Henson’s deeply empathetic performance--carry the film’s feverish emotions more than his characteristically ham-fisted screenplay.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perry's latest emotional roller coaster starts with considerable promise and a high-wattage cast, including Taraji P. Henson and singers Gladys Knight and Mary J. Blige, before giving way to melodramatic predictability.</snippet>

         <snippet>Part musical, part love story, part family melodrama, part inspirational treacle, Tyler Perry's latest movie, I Can Do Bad All by Myself is something of an unholy mess. Alternately stupefying and entertaining, the film does benefit from a strong cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Perry has his moviemaking machine running smoothly, which is to say somewhat predictably.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perry also spices things up with two of his most reliable fallbacks: music, and Madea. Having packed his cast with singers, he allows them all a moment to shine, with songs that deliver his patented lessons (trust in yourself, trust in others, trust in God).</snippet>

         <snippet>This latest offering continues a trend toward increasingly mature moviemaking from the actor/writer/director.</snippet>

         <snippet>Contrived, sentimental, tonally bipolar, and as predictable as clockwork.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has so many dead moments that singing spots by Gladys Knight, Pastor Marvin Winans and Mary J. Blige simply highlight, rather than alleviate, the inertia.</snippet>

         <snippet>The laughs, meanwhile, are delivered by cross-dressing Perry’s sassy grandma Madea, whose wild threats of violence to children and adults alike are the only things that sporadically lighten up this narratively and grammatically dim redemption pap.</snippet>
