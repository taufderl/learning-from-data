         <snippet>Undiscriminating comedy fans hungering for the High School High of superhero parodies need look no further.</snippet>

         <snippet>Given the abysmal quality of recent spoof pics, it's saying something that Superhero Movie provides a fairly steady stream of midsized laughs -- and even the 40% or so of gags that just lie there aren't actively painful.</snippet>

         <snippet>How can you tell the target age for Superhero Movie is exactly 13 1/2 years? Because most of the jokes are Internet-related.</snippet>

         <snippet>The very act of writing critically about Superhero Movie inspires something of an existential crisis -- no one likely to turn out for it is reading this review, and anybody reading this review is probably not inclined to see it under any circumstances.</snippet>

         <snippet>Puerile and idiotic it may be, but Superhero Movie is nonetheless smarter than most of its lowbrow brethren in the Hollywood sub-sub-category known as the spoof movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Seems to have been given the comedy equivalent of blood thinner. It has the blazing satirical boldness to skewer the first Tobey Maguire Spider-Man -- and, amazingly, not much else.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's shocking about Superhero Movie is not that it's been advertised to death on Nickelodeon to impressionable children, but that it's a completely on-the-nose satire of "Spider-Man.‚Äù</snippet>

         <snippet>The gags are consistently weak, though actor Miles Fisher turns in a hair-raising impression of Tom Cruise.</snippet>

         <snippet>Predictable, flat, full of name-dropping, tragically unhip, and likely to make a decent amount of cash.</snippet>

         <snippet>No real mockery is intended by this harmless, mindless grab bag of slightly used gags, which lampoons some of the conventions of recent comic-book epics and adds the expected staples of juvenile humor: urine, vomit and intestinal gas.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a tonally confused comedy which, for once, doesn't go far enough comedically.</snippet>

         <snippet>This abysmal "Spider-Man" satire has more in common with the lamentable spate of "Epic" and "Date Movies" than Zucker and Nielsen's truly funny "Naked Gun" series.</snippet>
