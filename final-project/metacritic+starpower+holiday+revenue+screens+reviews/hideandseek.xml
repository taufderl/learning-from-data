         <snippet>As cliche-ridden horror films go, Hide and Seek builds a pretty darn good mousetrap.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s tightly paced and confidently styled. These times call for more daring in our horror films, but for this weekend, this will do the trick.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hide and Seek, despite early signs of higher goals, is a factory-standard box of shocks.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's main purpose seems to be to make audiences squirm uncomfortably. Yelp and shriek in armchair-clawing glee? Not likely.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the final revelation is laughably absurd, DeNiro and Fanning are so far inside their roles that one can't giggle for long.</snippet>

         <snippet>From the base-model script to the assembly-line thrills, everything about Hide and Seek is generic except its star.</snippet>

         <snippet>Aside from its relentless exploitation of a child, this minor thriller features an intriguing beginning, a middling middle and an increasingly silly end, with a multitude of red herrings going squoosh underfoot.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is OK for a January horror picture, but given the premise and the cast--it should wring you out emotionally as it's scaring you witless.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not technically true to say the movie cheats, but let's say it abandons the truth and depth of its earlier scenes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Through its first two-thirds, at least, Hide and Seek does a good enough job of piquing our curiosity that the movie's ultimate dumbness is more than a minor insult.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's last 20 minutes devolve into a tedious slog through the kind of pointless, predictable running and screaming that give horror movies a bad name.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are twist endings and there are twist endings -- and then there is the logic-strangling, complete cheat of a reveal that takes place in the final 10 minutes of Hide and Seek. It's so absolutely preposterous that it stops the film cold and draws a collective "Aw c'mon!"</snippet>

         <snippet>That Mr. De Niro and especially Miss Fanning manage to register through all this murk is a testament to their talent, which however squandered does nonetheless shine.</snippet>

         <snippet>It all falls apart at the end, however, and in such a loud and abrasive way that it makes Brian De Palma's "Raising Cain" look like a model of restraint.</snippet>

         <snippet>De Niro gives a crafty performance, and director John Polson (Swimfan) maintains a pleasantly low-key suspense. But the ending is a disappointment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like far too many junky post-"Sixth Sense"  thrillers, Hide And Seek essentially exists for the sake of its third-act plot twist, but the climactic revelation merely pushes it from bad to worse.</snippet>

         <snippet>A thriller without thrills. It's also a thriller that cheats. The story is stretched to feature length only by having the film's incidents arranged in such a way as to reveal as little as possible.</snippet>

         <snippet>May steal from the best, but it does it so badly and obviously that it has to depend upon gratuitous shock-cuts and soundtrack stings to elicit any kind of reflex-action fright from the viewer.</snippet>
