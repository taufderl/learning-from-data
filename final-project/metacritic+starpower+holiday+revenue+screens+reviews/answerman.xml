         <snippet>Though his film is a tad choppy and a lot chatty, Hindman elicits sympathetic performances from leads who demonstrate a deep understanding of movie physics.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Answer Man is a passable way to kill two hours on a lazy summer afternoon, and perhaps an excuse to get out of the heat.</snippet>

         <snippet>A promising premise and some very good actors are smothered in goo in The Answer Man.</snippet>

         <snippet>A theological trifle that ultimately twists itself into a romantic comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>How much more interesting is a film like "(500) Days of Summer," which is about the complexities of life, in comparison with this one, which cheerfully cycles through the cliches.</snippet>

         <snippet>Daniels plays Arlen with a kind of cuddly crankiness; he makes him a jerk who just needs a hug.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hindman is a stand-up comedian with many Turgenev-size issues on his mind--inadequate fathers and troubled sons, overprotective mothers, the search for belief--whose weight this slight picture can hardly bear. But the laid-back charm of Daniels and Graham's bumpy courtship gives the movie a much-needed edge of idiosyncrasy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Conveniently, everyone wears their symptoms on their sleeves, but because the characters are so haphazardly drawn, their pain remains elusive to the end.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jeff Daniels' gleeful misanthropy and Lauren Graham's emotional openness are poorly served by the pic's transparently phony story and therapeutic uplift</snippet>

         <snippet>This two-bit echo of "The Accidental Tourist" is a preachy pill that wastes the genial, funny Jeff Daniels and the criminally underused Lauren Graham.</snippet>
