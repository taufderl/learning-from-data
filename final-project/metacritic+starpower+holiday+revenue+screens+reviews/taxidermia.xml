         <snippet>Only for fans of the bizarre and certainly not for those with even a faintly weak stomach. But for those meeting both qualifications: Welcome to a devious little nightmare.</snippet>

         <snippet>A brilliant, often grotesquely bizarre allegory on life in Hungary from World War II to the present.</snippet>

         <snippet>Belongs to a school of Central European surrealism that marries nightmarish horror with formal beauty.</snippet>

         <snippet>Taxidermia sets a benchmark for body horror in the cinema.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a film so pessimistic about mankind, Taxidermia erupts with some light-hearted technical inspiration: Cinematographer Gergely Poharnok's compositions are wickedly hilarious, while production designer Adrien Asztalos' concoctions are peculiarly gross.</snippet>

         <snippet>All this helps to shape Pálfi’s crudely bombastic but impressive philosophical view of the body as landscape and art, a source of personal discovery, wonder and annihilation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Keeping it surreal has never been so nauseating and, at times, hilarious.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite its stomach-turning images (and maybe because of), it is a daring, provocative work by a talented helmer who gets off pushing the envelope. He should be supported, no matter how outlandish he gets.</snippet>
