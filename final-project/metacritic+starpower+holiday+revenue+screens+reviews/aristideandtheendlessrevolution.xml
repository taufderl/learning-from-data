         <snippet>Rossier's film leaves the dispiriting impression that democracy simply will not be tolerated in the Southern Hemisphere.</snippet>

         <snippet>The question that lies at the heart of the documentary Aristide and the Endless Revolution is whether his exile was his own idea or whether he was pressured, even kidnapped, by the United States.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nicolas Rossier's cohesive documentary covers this complex incident - and Haiti's deteriorating condition since Mr. Aristide's exile - in a taut, well-balanced 82 minutes.</snippet>

         <snippet>A vital if less than objective slice of film journalism on the U.S.'s troubled history in the Third World.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fortunately, unlike so many similarly politically themed documentaries, the film makes its case with substantial intelligence and conviction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Investigates the events leading up to the coup d'Ã©tat; that it was the second for Aristide (overthrown in 1991, mere months after becoming Haiti's first democratically elected president) darkens the film's triumphalist-sounding title.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's enough mystery and agony here for an engaging documentary, but Rossier fails to produce one, largely because he doesn't approach the material in the spirit of true inquiry.</snippet>
