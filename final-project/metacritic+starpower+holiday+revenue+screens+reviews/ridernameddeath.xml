         <snippet>Think of it as a dark, suspenseful scenario penned by Joseph Conrad and designed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Auguste Renoir, and jump right in.</snippet>

         <snippet>Instead of using its hot-button issues as a present-day hook, sticks with a 19th century mindset which it accompanies with elegant turn-of-the-century decors.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shakhnazarov's film effortlessly captures the times and the author's conflicted yet unyielding attitude, yet it never draws any conclusions -- the film remains under glass.</snippet>

         <snippet>A visually lavish but somewhat sterile adaptation.</snippet>

         <snippet>You can't fault the film's elegant look. But you have to wonder why Shakhnazarov, one of Russian's most experienced filmmakers, didn't take more care with the script.</snippet>

         <snippet>In spite of good performances and colorful design, The Rider Named Death is too grave and remote to stir much emotion.</snippet>

         <snippet>The force of the film is not as profound as Shakhnazarov clearly intended, and The Rider Named Death is easier to respect than enjoy.</snippet>

         <snippet>All the same, The Rider Named Death is curiously anemic; rather than passion, outrage, and danger, we're contemplating the sotto voce conspiracy love of a quaintly distant age, when results weren't quite as emotionally important as commitment and camaraderie.</snippet>

         <snippet>To make a film in 2005 that asks audiences to sympathize with the plight of a band of terrorists is an intellectually audacious gesture.</snippet>

         <snippet>Curiously flat and immobile.</snippet>
