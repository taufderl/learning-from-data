         <snippet>Delicious slapstick, droll wit and terrific characters make Aardman's first venture in CG cartooning a great success.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shot through with cheeky wit and hilarious musical numbers by the aforementioned slugs, Flushed Away features an eye-popping boat chase through London's watery nether regions, as well as the winning vocal talent of Kate Winslet, Bill Nighy and Ian McKellen, doing his best Sydney Greenstreet. Well done!</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not life-changing stuff, but it's brisk and clever and funny and avoids some of the predictable pitfalls that hobble so many films of its ilk.</snippet>

         <snippet>As with the Wallace &amp; Gromit films, most of the fun is in the deft characterizations, the zippy banter, and the joyous sight gags.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's filled to overflowing with mischievous gags for kids and adults alike, tickling the periphery of the story and crammed into every frame with playful abandon. It gives potty humor a good name.</snippet>

         <snippet>Flushed Away lacks the action-contraption dottiness of a Wallace and Gromit adventure, but it hits its own sweet spot of demented delight.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a sewer blessedly free of actual sewage, which makes Flushed Away more kid-friendly than, say, the average "South Park" episode.</snippet>

         <snippet>The best sections of Flushed Away, those featuring a nefarious French operative known as Le Frog (a hilarious Jean Reno), are also the most peculiarly British; no one lampoons the French with a better mixture of hard-earned loathing and grudging respect than the Brits.</snippet>

         <snippet>While you watch, be sure to scour the background for in-jokes, including cameos by Gromit and other DreamWorks characters, and rest assured that Flushed Away gets even funnier on second viewing.</snippet>

         <snippet>How this thing got made in Hollywood is a mystery, but I laughed at most of it, especially the mean stereotypes about the French and the even meaner stereotype about England's soccer team.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a movie that takes place mostly in the bowels of a sewer, Flushed Away has some surprisingly charming moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's better than 90% of the animated fare of the last few years. It's refreshing not to have to qualify the movie's appeal by appending the words, "for the kids."</snippet>

         <snippet>This computer-animated feature rivals "Cars" for the year's most visually exciting cartoon, but watch your step - most of the movie takes place in the London sewers, where the script may have been conceived.</snippet>
