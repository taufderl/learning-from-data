         <snippet>A smart, marvelously drawn account of the bravery of homing pigeons during World War II.</snippet>

         <snippet>Valiant enlists a squad of loveable birdbrains to turn the classic fighter-pilot formula into an upbeat adventure film loaded with laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the target audience won't be as familiar with the voice of Gervais as with, say, Eddie Murphy, they'll no doubt love his dirty bird humor.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a tale with plenty of spirit and a good heart, and yet, this story doesn't so much soar across the screen as it does waddle.</snippet>

         <snippet>The best sequence comes when the gang meet a saucy French lady mouse who works for the Resistance and at moments of high drama sings "Je Ne Regrette Rien" ("Ah!" your children will say. "At last, an Edith Piaf joke!")</snippet>

         <snippet>Competently done and harmless enough to entertain the tots. It's just that the movie's kind of . . . sparse.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite a decent cast of mostly British voice actors and better-than-average computer animation, the movie seems rushed at 76 minutes and is only marginally funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not as clever as it thinks it is, not as funny or exciting as it should be, and not as engaging as it needs to be to prevent kids from losing interest and parents from falling asleep.</snippet>

         <snippet>The voice acting is adequate, but it fails to convey the diversity or personality of "Chicken Run" or "Shrek."</snippet>

         <snippet>Given all its World War II references and parodies, the best audience for Valiant would be addled, octogenarian ex-RAF pilots in the old folks' home.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mite too hard to follow for most of the kiddie crowd who'll want to see it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The CG is on the rubbery side, and the backdrops are jarringly 2-D. But Valiant isn't so hard to look at -- it's hard to listen to.</snippet>

         <snippet>The main problem with this Disney release--which also wastes the voices of Ricky Gervais and Jim Broadbent--is its refusal to recognize the war as anything but an excuse for tomfoolery.</snippet>

         <snippet>Valiant is voiced by Robots' Ewan McGregor, an actor apparently no longer in a "Trainspotting" mood.</snippet>

         <snippet>The violence is minimal, and the humor is inoffensive enough for tots, but everything is damned soft--from the fuzzy backgrounds to the enemy's diluted Germanness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Valiant is in dire need of some "Shrek"-ian sass, not to mention a drop or two of genuine emotion.</snippet>

         <snippet>An unconscionably dreary and amateurish-looking thing, and the rote plot and annoyingly predictable script -- a compendium of bird puns, mostly -- don't work nearly hard enough to make up for the hammy awfulness of the images.</snippet>
