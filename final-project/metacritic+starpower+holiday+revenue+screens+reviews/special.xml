         <snippet>The movie loses its way toward the end, shifting from wry black comedy to slightly overdone pathos. But there's plenty here to appreciate, making the title perfectly apt.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a weird little movie, and it's an interesting trip accompanying Dick Ritchie on his transformation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Special recalls a minor-key "Donnie Darko," but its vision is much more limited, and it sinks into Indiewood cliché whenever it reaches for profundity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thanks to Rapaport's brio in embracing the hero's drug-induced delusions, the movie is less a failure than a noble experiment gone awry.</snippet>

         <snippet>All that's left then is a miserablist analogue to M. Night Shyamalan's "Unbreakable," a sad portrait of paranoid delusion with wipe-out stunts played for the comic wincing of "Jackass."</snippet>

         <snippet>Either way, it doesn’t quite go far enough as psychological study or cultural commentary.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rappaport does a yeoman's job in this tonally confused oddity. The wonder is that Hal Haberman and Jeremy Passmore's Special is making it off the festival circuit and into theaters at all, however briefly.</snippet>
