         <snippet>With some excellent staging, fine cinematography and first-rate acting, the film largely overcomes the awe it demonstrates for its principal character and succeeds in creating a mystery where perhaps there is none.</snippet>

         <snippet>If it all adds up to too much for one film to encompass with ease, Monsieur N, is certainly richer than most of what you'll find on the History Channel.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film holds us principally because of its Napoleon. Philippe Torreton doesn't perform the role: he exists.</snippet>

         <snippet>And though at over two hours the movie is too long and too slow, de Caunes sustains a sense of mystery and ambiguity to the end of what is both a satisfying character study and a stately quasi-thriller for amateur historians.</snippet>

         <snippet>An intricate, fetchingly lensed tale of historical speculation framed as a plausible thriller.</snippet>

         <snippet>De Caunes and screenwriter René Manzor do well when they dwell on history from a mundane human perspective, but Monsieur N. is too dry and too unsurprising for its two-hour running time.</snippet>

         <snippet>As modest conspiracy-mongering, the movie is perfectly robust, earning its dramatic impact from its classical sense of intrigue and Philippe Torreton's testy performance in the title role.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end Monsieur N. could use a little less cloak-and-dagger and more of what made "The Emperor's New Clothes" work, i.e., heart.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film tends to be pretentious and melodramatic; and Grant, better suited to comic roles, gives a heavy-handed performance.</snippet>

         <snippet>The second half of Antoine de Caunes' Monsieur N., about the post-exile life and death of Napoleon, plays less like a movie than a suggestion for one. This is a great disappointment because the first half is very cinematic and very compelling.</snippet>
