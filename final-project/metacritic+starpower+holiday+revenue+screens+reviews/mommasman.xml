         <snippet>One of the sweetest, saddest stories Franz Kafka never wrote.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's time to stop calling Azazel Jacobs a "promising" filmmaker. With Momma's Man, Jacobs achieves the promise.</snippet>

         <snippet>It works from a specific place and lets audiences relate to that place, and the people in it, like trusted intimates.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mastery of tone is everything here, and Azazel's control, combined with his wit, perception, discretion and easy command of the visual and of his cast makes Momma's Man a gem.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Jacobs has succeeded at one of the most difficult tasks given a director, which is to make a character come alive through the filmmaking, not exposition.</snippet>

         <snippet>Deeper, darker currents move through Momma's Man, eddying around fears of letting go on both sides of the generational divide.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps the most indispensable cast member  is the Jacobs' dwelling, their residence since 1966.</snippet>

         <snippet>A comedy of sorts, though to Jacobs' credit, he doesn't aim for cheap laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wryly comic, sometimes heartbreaking and altogether original film about a thirtysomething Angeleno who pays a visit to his aging New York parents and finds himself unwilling or unable to leave.</snippet>

         <snippet>A little miracle, Azazel Jacobs' lovely story of a life lost and found tackles big issues -love, maturity, fulfillment - in deceptively modest fashion.</snippet>

         <snippet>Momma's Man takes that germ of an idea and lets it flower, in a way that is both odd and oddly compelling.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Momma's Man taps into that ambivalence, and those moments when all of us long to flee adulthood and sink back into being our parents' beloved baby birds, whether or not we ever were in the first place.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is quiet and minimal in its dialogue, and it has flashes of humor and thoughtfulness. However, it's also unbearably slow and hard to empathize with Mikey when we don't really know what his problem is.</snippet>
