         <snippet>Gigante represents the sort of artful low-budget accomplishment that could, and should, be coming out of distressingly stingy Chicago once a year — whatever the subject, whatever the sensibility.</snippet>

         <snippet>Camandule gives a strong performance as the lovesick guard, but Svarcas gets little chance to show her skills. There's minimal dialogue and camera movement -- but lots of charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>Because of the limitations imposed by the nature of Gigante, and because of Jara's simple, almost childish shyness, the film doesn't transcend its characters. Like Jara, it waits and watches.</snippet>

         <snippet>As unpretentious as it is perceptive, Gigante is a gem.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is an appealing, gently comedic prologue to a love story.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's an interesting film but not enthralling, a little like Steven Soderbergh's "Bubble" minus the element of crime.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is impeccable but distant, lacking in spontaneity and not very original.</snippet>

         <snippet>The problem is that the film also refuses to move beyond a glacial pace, and its choice to go slow-and-low doesn’t scream art-house aesthetic so much as unintentionally sluggish. For such a small character study, that decision ends up being a doozy of a deal breaker.</snippet>

         <snippet>With potentially lethargic materials, Biniez has made a quiet, intent, involving film, a moony-innocent urban alienation fairy tale of bashful ogre and village beauty--and it never quite crests.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it takes time to find its courage and heart, Gigante, like its oversized hero, merely has a slow, shy way of doing things.</snippet>
