         <snippet>This digitized update, with Jason Lee as a huskier, more generic Underdog, mostly drops the doggerel, but the endearing airborne-beagle effects help to offset the formula twists.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you're expecting anything resembling the beloved cartoon, you'll enjoy the title sequence and nothing else. If, however, you set your expectations just low enough, or are an easily satisfied 8-year-old, you might have a bit of fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>Made for viewers old enough to appreciate a talking pooch but too young to read or write about it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie isn't nearly as bad as you would expect when the studio holds its only press screening the night before a national opening.</snippet>

         <snippet>Falls somewhere between stale retread and half-hearted parody of superhero-movie formulas.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even the promising team of Peter Dinklage’s mad scientist Simon Barsinister and Patrick Warburton’s henchman Cad turns out to be a bust.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite the talent on show, there's little to distinguish this from any other bland family comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The elements of the film don’t quite mesh: The villains are cartoony, but Du Chau aims for soggy family drama in his father-son story.</snippet>

         <snippet>The TV show was mildly subversive, with humor that children and adults could enjoy on different levels, but the movie strives for a blander, family-oriented middle ground.</snippet>

         <snippet>Regardless, what probably made the show so tolerable and popular was the fact that each episode was under a half an hour long. This movie is about 84 minutes long and gets tiresome after the first 20 minutes or so.</snippet>

         <snippet>For adults -- even adults with fond memories of the TV series -- this is one bizarre mess.</snippet>

         <snippet>The bite and bark of Underdog are both pretty awful, but little kids might take this pooch for a walk.</snippet>

         <snippet>Underdog!  Rest assured, there is no superhero cliche left unchewed; they even manage to slide in a "Lady and the Tramp" homage while they're at it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Underdog may have been originally created to sell cereal for General Mills, but this latest incarnation couldn't sell Frisbees at a dog park.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Frederik Du Chau's big-screen Underdog has all of the cartoons' crudeness and none of their charm. It's the celluloid equivalent of sugar cereal: cheap, empty and headache-inducing.</snippet>
