         <snippet>A sports bio movie that I really enjoyed about a sport and sports hero I barely knew existed: the World Hour Record competition for bicyclists and its gutsy, tormented and most unusual champion, Graeme Obree.</snippet>

         <snippet>Obree's psychology is fascinating and, even though the competitive scenes mostly involve him racing against himself in a spectator-free indoor track, the movie manages to give its audience a suitable adrenaline rush here and there.</snippet>

         <snippet>How many bicycling movies are there, let alone ones that know from frame geometry?  "Breaking Away" is probably the champ, followed by "American Flyers," the hilariously awful Kevin Bacon bike-messenger movie "Quicksilver," and then we're already into "The Bicycle Thief " and "Pee-wee's Big Adventure." It's a small pack, and The Flying Scotsman rides close to the front by default.</snippet>

         <snippet>Miller is key to the film's success, with his earnest, sweet-faced looks and evident dark side. He plays Obree with just the right understated intensity, a believable competitor who fights back fiercely with his wits and a few tight-lipped words.</snippet>

         <snippet>A typically engaging performance from Johnny Lee Miller takes this slightly above the usual underdog movie cliche.</snippet>

         <snippet>Helmer Douglas Mackinnon does what he can to make the most of emotional bullet points and gloss over the lack of connective tissue.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's real triumph to Obree's story, and real adversity, too, but the film contents itself with the pretend versions of both.</snippet>

         <snippet>The filmmaking is unremarkable, but the obsessiveness of the lead character is infectious enough to make this drama passable entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Graeme Obree was a champion bicycler who, by all accounts, rarely took the easy way out. Too bad this movie version of his life doesn't follow suit.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brian Cox does sturdy work as the minister who helps Obree combat depression, and first-time director Douglas Mackinnon gets a big assist from Obree himself, who doubled for Miller in some shots and filmed others with a camera strapped to his handlebars.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a shame it's not a better movie, but its small virtues include an uncompromising performance by English actor Jonny Lee Miller.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the world of competitive cycling can be extremely exciting, not every one of its events is captivating. A well-intentioned biopic about Scottish cycling maverick Graeme Obree, The Flying Scotsman is hampered by the fact that its hero earned his greatest renown for riding around and around on a velodrome … alone … for an hour.</snippet>

         <snippet>Scotsman not only lacks vision, a true sense of how to mesh Obree's sporting triumphs and personal setbacks, but it also lacks passion. What it needs, as strange and tacky as it may sound, is a bit more madness.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a much better film about a similar story, rent "The World's Fastest Indian," with Anthony Hopkins on a motorcycle.</snippet>

         <snippet>It has a terminal case of the cutes crossed with the labored earnestness of a disease-of-the-week melodrama.</snippet>
