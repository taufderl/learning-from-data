         <snippet>The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible.</snippet>

         <snippet>The situations might be formulaic, but the teamwork of the two leads brings them to sparkling life.</snippet>

         <snippet>Recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out. You see it coming from a great distance away. As it draws closer, you don't duck out of the way, because it is so cheerfully done, you don't mind being hit by it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just a good old-fashioned romance, one in which people actually bring out the best in one another rather than the worst. How novel is that?</snippet>

         <snippet>It's as predictable and comforting as a Happy Meal, but it must be said that The Proposal manages to elicit some genuinely amusing moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Proposal won't catch any bouquets for originality, but in terms of a bended-knee pitch for the affections of women -- including Ryan Reynolds’ boyish charms, a hip granny and even a beyond-adorable puppy -- this romantic comedy pretty much pulls out all the stops.</snippet>

         <snippet>If it weren't for the casting of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds in the lead roles, the film probably would have gone straight to DVD.</snippet>

         <snippet>Betty White is what makes this film memorable as Andrew’s grandmother. She steals every scene, and adds the sweetness that a film like this needs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ms. Bullock, who excels at playing spunky, is as appealing as usual, but the role proves as awkward as those heels.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fletcher demonstrates, as with her second film, "27 Dresses," that she can put together a funny, able romantic comedy that is a cut above, but no more. Still, those leads are awfully likable, the Massachusetts-for-Alaska landscape rather picturesque, and if The Proposal doesn't reinvent the wheel, merrily we roll along nonetheless.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's impossible to guess why Bullock was ever attracted to this insulting role, and the eternally confident Reynolds is miscast as a young, bullied underling.</snippet>

         <snippet>Neither (Bullock/Reynolds) brings out anything good in the other, and watching them try hurts the eyes, the tummy, and the libido.</snippet>

         <snippet>Why is she (Bullock) demeaning herself with such shoddy goods? She’s a talented woman with a faithful following. She has made formula films of varying quality before, and her fans may well swallow this one, but it’s a formula for disappointment laced with dismay.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film saddles Craig T. Nelson with the generally thankless role of Paxton's cold, distant dad. But when he feels like the only person who doesn't understand what's going on with Tate and his son, you feel like saying, "No, me too."</snippet>
