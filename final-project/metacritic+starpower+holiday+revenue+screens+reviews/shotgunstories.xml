         <snippet>An allegory of our times, Shotgun Stories is a tragedy of biblical scale and an intimate family drama. Unlike the more lauded films of last year, which glorified a national preoccupation with bloody deeds, Shotgun Stories is a passionate cry to end the violence and a reminder that we, as free individuals, have the power to determine our own destinies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Here is a tense and sorrowful film where common sense struggles with blood lust.</snippet>

         <snippet>An understated gem. Writer-director Jeff Nichols, making his feature debut, has created a richly textured world.</snippet>

         <snippet>Well-plotted, with a strong lead performance by Michael Shannon, and a fair amount of authentic regional flavor. It isn't really meant to be a treatise on Southern life. At heart, it's a country-fried genre film, minus the peppery white gravy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is a here-and-now American potboiler and a stripped-down parable that can be appreciated by any culture.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cast deliver consistently fine, subtle performances, underscored by Ben Nichols' mournfully melodic guitar score.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's rare that a picture that deals with as much tragedy as this one also manages to convey as much warmth to its characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>An austere rural landscape, festering hatred, class tensions, terse dialogue - these are common currency in indie movies these days. Shotgun Stories uses them all, but manages to stand out from the crowd.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Jeff Nichols lets the action unfold slowly following an impromptu insult, but the escalation of hatred and pain feels natural.</snippet>

         <snippet>At the center of the film is a keenly understated performance by Michael Shannon (Bug, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead) as the eldest of the cast-off sons.</snippet>

         <snippet>In this tense, lyrical and bone-spare slice-of-death drama by writer-director Jeff Nichols, Shannon gets a role tailored to his lanky Middle American boyishness and the demons peering from behind it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie makes you empathize with the rage that drives these young men to violence--but it also makes you see how manly action wipes out their individuality, their uniqueness, and turns them into archetypal meatheads.</snippet>
