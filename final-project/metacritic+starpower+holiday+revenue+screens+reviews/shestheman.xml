         <snippet>Most of the laughs are due to Bynes, a vibrant young actress with excellent comedic chops.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a perfectly pleasant, entertaining and often witty romp with engaging performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>Of Amanda Bynes let us say that she is sunny and plucky and somehow finds a way to play her impossible role without clearing her throat more than six or eight times.</snippet>

         <snippet>It will certainly appeal to its target audience, and Bynes is charming enough to carry the whole film on her shoulders, which is a good thing considering that she's in just about every scene and leading man Tatum is a stiff.</snippet>

         <snippet>A screwball comedy that made me wish I were 13 again, because this is precisely the kind of movie I would have gone nuts for in the ninth grade.</snippet>

         <snippet>So good-natured, and its cast seems to enjoy itself so thoroughly, that the total annihilation of disbelief it requires winds up feeling like a reasonable enough request.</snippet>

         <snippet>The girls who adore the likable Everygirl Bynes will find a lot to enjoy about the film, especially the boys who look as though they just were lounging around the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch catalog.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fickman mostly soft-pedals the play's homosexual panic, generating a comedy that lacks both the verbal sophistication of its source and the sexual sophistication of its target audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>As insistent as its heroine to get its point across, She's the Man gathers up enough energy and likeable goodwill that it almost skirts past some extremely strained passages in which Bynes plays out being a boy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Doesn't have an unpredictable moment in it, borrowing heavily from just about every sports movie or teen comedy ever and, oh yeah, "Twelfth Night."</snippet>

         <snippet>She’s the Man amounts to little more than softcore porn for the tween set, with aesthetics ripped from the pages of the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch catalog and virtually every scene revolving around Viola/Sebastian’s crafty escape from some impromptu disrobing.</snippet>

         <snippet>As an actress, Bynes is wholesome to a fault. She impersonates a teenage boy yet never gives him one good dirty thought.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everything projects as if for the benefit of a nearsighted and dimwitted ticket holder at the back of the room. To his credit, Mr. Fickman has mastered one device unique to the cinema, making repeated use of the corny training montage.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fails to exploit the myriad comedic possibilities, settling instead for broad, unconvincing slapstick aimed at 12-year-olds and gags Shakespeare would have rejected as ancient.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bynes appears in practically every scene, and the film seems to have been designed as a showcase for her comedic skills, which she apparently left behind in the trailer.</snippet>
