         <snippet>By no means a landmark, but it is a remarkably pleasant surprise -- so few movies aimed for the whole family show an understanding of why it's actually healthy to pretend.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Murphy rises to every occasion, not only with the crisp wit that has long been his hallmark, but with restraint and tenderness that serve him well.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eddie Murphy strikes the right balance between silliness and pathos in this screwball family comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's refreshing that in effects-happy Hollywood, Evan and Olivia only imagine their travels, rather than run a gantlet of computerized hallucinations. This may turn out to be one of the more endearing aspects of Imagine That to its younger audiences.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a much more playable film than recent efforts, though Murphy will have to share the applause with young Yara Shahidi.</snippet>

         <snippet>All in all, Imagine That is an amiable detour from its star's usual scatological skronk. Kids will empathize, parents will breathe a sigh of relief.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite an overly broad third act, one can't fault the film's message of family unity, underscored by a memorable use of the Beatles' "All You Need Is Love."</snippet>

         <snippet>While Imagine That falls short of its feel-good aim, its feel-nice vibe is a good Father's Day diversion for Dads and their spawn.</snippet>

         <snippet>Twenty-five years ago, it would have been impossible to imagine that Imagine That would see Eddie Murphy and The Beatles coming together to create family entertainment, but I'll be darned if it doesn't work.</snippet>

         <snippet>For the first time since "The Nutty Professor," Eddie Murphy successfully mixes his adult and kid-film personas -- imagine that.</snippet>

         <snippet>Imagine That does manage to get a crowd tearing up on cue for its emotional climax; as much as it works, it's through the personal charm of Murphy and Shahidi.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though Imagine That's message is benign, its adult focus is off-base, and every move feels too familiar, formulaic and telegraphed.</snippet>
