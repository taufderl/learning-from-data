         <snippet>Overall, "Moonlight" is a nuttily engaging tale of betrayal and, perhaps, redemption.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's been a long time since Ryan has had a romantic comedy that gave her room to move and though the scale is smaller here, the humor blacker and Ryan well beyond the first blush phase, you'll be glad that Serious Moonlight came along.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a pleasure to watch Ryan resurrect her trademark persona, a mix of perkiness and pique, as she flounces around the room. But it's shaded with a middle-age desperation that's half real and half chick-flick shtick.</snippet>

         <snippet>What may have started out as a comedy devolves into quasi-Stephen King territory.</snippet>

         <snippet>More strident than funny, the film illustrates that old French proverb, "Marriage is like a cage; one sees the birds outside desperate to get in, and those inside desperate to get out."</snippet>

         <snippet>I appreciate that talented people wanted to honor Shelly by making this film. They likely would have better honored her by mounting her script as a play.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a lot of yelling, cracking wise, and cooing in this creepy rom-com.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you want to see a good comedy about a couple’s marital problems getting worked out through the course of a home invasion, check out "The Ref."</snippet>

         <snippet>A less-than-frothy domestic showdown starring Meg Ryan and Timothy Hutton, it owes as much to Edward Albee as to Nora Ephron, with an occasional nod to "A Clockwork Orange."</snippet>

         <snippet>Serious Moonlight has a backstory much more intriguingly dramatic than what's onscreen.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has neither enough bite nor enough heart to sustain it as a female-revenge-fantasy-cum-romantic-comedy; even its “shocking” switcheroo and faux-edgy moments seem remarkably frivolous and flavorless.</snippet>

         <snippet>The bitter comedy Serious Moonlight is meant to be both funny and painful, but manages only the latter.</snippet>

         <snippet>A very shallow comedy. For the real thing, rent “The Ref,” in which Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis, with a boost from Glynis Johns, set the house on fire.</snippet>

         <snippet>Serious Moonlight is a tonal disaster, distasteful and sentimental by turns. It was probably a mistake to have Hines try to walk that same delicate line that took Shelly her entire career to master.</snippet>

         <snippet>A shrill farce that strains credibility even by the standards of black comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's also suffocatingly stagy, especially when the husband's new love (Kristen Bell) and a violent thief (Justin Long) show up.</snippet>
