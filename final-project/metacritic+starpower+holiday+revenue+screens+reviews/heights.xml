         <snippet>There's much subtle beauty in the last movie completed by Merchant Ivory Productions before Merchant's untimely death.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fox uses her earth-tone-clad, Ivy-League-schooled characters the way Jane Austen used hers: taking their privileged, rigid social structures and building a stage to explore deeper human problems.</snippet>

         <snippet>Heights is stage-bound throughout, and the secrets it would like to keep are very predictable. But its heart is in the right place, and the performances are first-rate.</snippet>

         <snippet>Heights breathes, is briefly and immediately present, and is over. In this summer of noisy steroid cinema, such small favors are welcome.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is one of those interlocking dramas where all of the characters are involved in each other's lives, if only they knew it. We know, and one of our pleasures is waiting for the pennies to drop.</snippet>

         <snippet>Beautifully shot on location in New York and consistently well-acted, but it sticks a little too closely to the surface to be very compelling.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Chris Terrio confidently delivers a solid first feature, but sometimes doesn’t always engage in the characters’ inner demons, which could have made an even better film given the cast and material.</snippet>

         <snippet>These are not people me and you and everyone we know know--these are "short version" people, characters who comfort each other by quoting Shakespeare.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is brisk and fun to watch, thanks to the actors...But once you catch the main drift of the plot, it becomes awfully ho-hum.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Chris Terrio adapts Amy Fox's play with flashes of wit, moments of insight, and some fine performances. But Heights' characters move along such preordained paths and perform such familiar movie actions that they might as well sport antennae.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like the film, the characters mean well and look good. But they're so deeply immersed in their own heads that they can't see the world for their needs.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Terrio keeps the multiple stories flowing smoothly, and the setting goes a long way to justify the web of fortuitous interconnections -- New York is the ultimate two-degrees-of-separation town.</snippet>

         <snippet>As enjoyable as Close is, Heights as a whole is a mannered simulation that only occasionally and accidentally feels like real New York life.</snippet>

         <snippet>Heights manages to make the lives of all these beautiful people seem quite tedious. Despite their accomplishments, the only thing they seem suited for is hailing cabs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Heights is nothing more than a second-rate version of several much better movies, all of which are available on DVD and video.</snippet>
