         <snippet>In the end, this earnest, inquisitive film leaves the viewer longing for some sanity, and some hope, in a world that appears to be seriously lacking in both.</snippet>

         <snippet>Levin crawls into America's woodwork to ferret out anti-Semites of all stripes, then rushes at them with Socratic reasoning -- a futile and often hilarious project, since they prove immune to thought reform, however rational.</snippet>

         <snippet>As the film loses its focus on the "Protocols" phenomenon -- it becomes too scattered to have the impact Levin is after.</snippet>

         <snippet>Makes it case expertly and powerfully, but it does not propose a solution. The cumulative effect of the film's message is enormous sadness that hate is so strong and so resistant to reason.</snippet>

         <snippet>Protocols of Zion is often funny, revealing the idiocy of hatemongers through their own harebrained explanations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Entertaining and substantial enough to attract at least a portion of the Michael Moore audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>This absorbing essay amply demonstrates that, as with any sort of racial-nationalist paranoia, anti-Semitism has very little to do with actual Jews and everything to do with imagined ones.</snippet>

         <snippet>Would have benefited from a tighter focus. There are too many interviews with crazies - and Levin's failed attempt to get Jewish entertainers to discuss "The Passion of the Christ" should have ended up on the cutting room floor.</snippet>

         <snippet>Levin learned nothing that should surprise anyone who is both sentient and sane. But in tracing much of this contemporary anti-Semitism to a phony 19th-century document in which Jewish leaders lay out plans for taking over the world, we at least get some understanding of how some twisted people justify their hatred and fear of Jews.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too often, Levin confuses passion with focus, intensity with clarity, and deflating lies with discovering truths.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie goes off the rails only when the filmmaker inadvertently legitimizes the Protocols' loony philosophical heirs by interviewing a New York medical examiner and a widow about the remains of one of 9/11's Jewish victims.</snippet>

         <snippet>Levin's on-camera presence is warm, wry and even-tempered, and he never feels the need to rub anything in.</snippet>

         <snippet>If it's meant as a retort to anti-Semitic doctrine, it's far too episodic, anecdotal and lacking in specifics.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's frustrating to watch Levin try to reason with far-gone street-corner evangelicals (whose arguments are preposterous at best) when he might be building a stronger case by other means.</snippet>

         <snippet>The filmmaker keeps himself squarely on screen. This is fine when he engages in throwdowns with the bigots but distasteful when Levin shows himself reacting to footage -- unseen by viewers -- of the beheading of reporter Daniel Pearl.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, however, Protocols of Zion illuminates manifestations of anti-Semitism without ever really elucidating or posing solutions to the problem.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, Protocols of Zion is all context--a bit here about Father Coughlin, a minute there about the Holocaust, a stint with "The Passion" and a brief shot of Levin watching the beheading of Daniel Pearl--no soul.</snippet>
