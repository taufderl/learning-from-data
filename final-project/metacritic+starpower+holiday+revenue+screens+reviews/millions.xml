         <snippet>This sincere, delicate, and intrinsically religious comedy may also become that most unexpected of blessings - Danny Boyle's first family classic.</snippet>

         <snippet>The near-miracle worked by Mr. Boyle, whose exuberant style brings several saints to scruffy life, is a movie that's joyously funny and hugely inventive -- occasionally to the point of preciousness -- yet true to the spirit of the saintly little kid at its center.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's vibrant and verdant and heartbreakingly inviting, begging you to escape into a lovely tale in which children, through a simple act of faith, find their own heaven on earth.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is thriller, comedy and rite-of-passage story, but Boyle never loses sight of what's at its core.</snippet>

         <snippet>Witty, sweet and charming but never sappy, the movie joins the heady company of such extraordinary child-centered movies as "The 400 Blows," "My Life as a Dog" and "Au Revoir Les Enfants."</snippet>

         <snippet>Millions is that rarest of creatures: a family film - one of surprising warmth – that won't have adults reaching for an airsick bag.</snippet>

         <snippet>Millions, like all kid-powered movies, stands or falls in the first place on the performances of its child actors, and Alex Etel and Lewis McGibbon both delight.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie, though quite funny in parts, turns organically dark, and it refuses to paint a picture of a cotton-candy world. It prefers the real one.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's childhood done just right: part cotton candy angels, part gurning adult frighteners, and all wide-eyed kidhood bravado.</snippet>

         <snippet>You never know what to expect from Boyle, and that goes triple in this offbeat comedy drama. It's a movie about family that family viewers will find good, quirky fun.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>It's an uplifting motion picture that will bring smiles to faces, and Boyle's trademark irreverence keeps the feel-good experience from becoming too saccharine.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a family movie in the best sense; it plays to children without talking down and to their parents without pandering. Mostly, it's just good fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>This cheeky fable rests on the slender shoulders of Etel and McGibbon, and the lovely, natural performances Boyle elicits from them are the film's real miracle.</snippet>

         <snippet>A little broad comedy keeps things perky, but the kids' excellent, restrained acting and the low-key script by "The Claim" screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce hold the whole sprawling project together, from weepy revelations to silly fantasy-saint sequences.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is small-scale, cleverly crafted and feels like a more expensive version of the sort of "dramedy" they produce by the truckload at the BBC.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Mostly avoids being cloying but flirts with being precious. Yet Boyle is enough of a stylist to make it all passable. It's one of those films for which fans and detractors can see the others' viewpoint.</snippet>

         <snippet>Give Boyce and Boyle credit for daring to be strange, but this enchilada is so overstuffed, it's falling apart.</snippet>

         <snippet>By avoiding sentimentality, Millions emerges as a simple tale told with sympathy for a child's point of view.</snippet>

         <snippet>Danny Boyle's Millions is not what we'd expect from the "Trainspotting" and "28 Days Later" director. It's essentially a gentle, kid's-eye parable.</snippet>

         <snippet>And the movie, likable for short stretches, ends up seeming worn and frayed, like Christmas decorations left hanging until spring.</snippet>
