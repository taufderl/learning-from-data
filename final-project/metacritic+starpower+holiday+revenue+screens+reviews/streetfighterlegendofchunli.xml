         <snippet>Neither the best nor the worst of movies derived from videogames, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li at least gives action fans plenty to ogle besides the titular heroine (Kristin Kreuk), whose original incarnation, legend has it, was among the first distaff figures controllable by joystick.</snippet>

         <snippet>Reveling in the vivid Bangkok locations, Geoff Boyle’s photography is crisp and bright, and Dion Lam’s action choreography unusually witty.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Andrzej Bartkowiak ("Romeo Must Die") works hard to supply the appropriate grittiness, but other than a few reasonably well-staged fight sequences, the proceedings are dull and visually uninspired. Justin Marks' solemn screenplay lacks any trace of wit.</snippet>

         <snippet>A wholly inept action experience that works at boring us to tears.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a movie for the overcaffeinated, undereducated teenager in all of us.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's something special about this underwhelming mess of a Street Fighter reboot that many cinematic cheese-lovers will find very appetizing. The fact is that The Legend of Chun-Li is not at all a good flick, but it's filled with so much cornball ineptitude that one would think some rather broken mad movie genius was behind it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Idiot plotting and dialogue are what you'd expect from a genre that typically rewards narrative development with a skip function. But the rote fight scenes are a disappointment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even with the low expectations The Legend of Chun Li engenders, it still somehow manages to be a letdown.</snippet>

         <snippet>Don't be fooled by the low grade: This sequel-in-spirit to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1994 dud doesn't even succeed in being memorably bad.</snippet>

         <snippet>The problems with Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun-Li began with the casting of dead-eyed, sleepy-voiced, charisma-impaired automaton Kristin Kreuk.</snippet>

         <snippet>It boggles the mind that The Legend of Chun-Li is as vapid and dull as it is.</snippet>
