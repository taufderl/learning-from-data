         <snippet>It's crazy, dangerous and sometimes gorgeous: a feast of nuttiness that takes you, for a while, over the edge.</snippet>

         <snippet>This Southern Gothic Alice in Wonderland is not for the faint-hearted, to be sure, yet amid the swaying chaff there are moments of piercing grace and beauty when we'e reminded of the lost, lonely child at the heart of this tale. If nothing else, it's liberating to see one of cinema's unrepentant fantasists going out on a limb like this and cutting loose.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's no "trip through the dark to appreciate the light." It's a nightmare from start to finish.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tideland is equally evocative of the pastoral mystery of an Andrew Wyeth painting and the looming menace of "Psycho." The disparity is fitting, because as Tideland unfolds, it's difficult to tell if you're watching a fantasy or a horror movie, or one superimposed on the other.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tideland is the easiest of Gilliam's films to follow, yet the most disturbing to watch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gilliam has suffered more than his share of butchered projects, but with this exercise in kamikaze auteurism, he appears to have made exactly the mess he wanted.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tideland is, by turns, a complete bore and a creepy experience. And I don't mean "creepy" in a positive sense.</snippet>

         <snippet>A murky swamp of a movie, Terry Gilliam's defiantly surreal Tideland finds every good idea drowning in an excess of indulgence.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mix of "Alice in Wonderland" and William S. Burroughs, "Psycho" and the psychotic. It's pretty much a squirmy experience all around.</snippet>

         <snippet>A misconceived washout of a darkly gothic story of madness, addiction and child abuse made all the more unpleasant by Gilliam's trademark intense visual style.</snippet>

         <snippet>The worst that can be said of the first two-thirds of Tideland is that it is tiresome. Toward the end it becomes creepy, and not in a good way.</snippet>

         <snippet>When they’re used to tell a story as dreary, unfocused, and exhausting as Tideland, the director’s trademark dreamscapes and disorienting camera angles feel like so much artless window dressing.</snippet>
