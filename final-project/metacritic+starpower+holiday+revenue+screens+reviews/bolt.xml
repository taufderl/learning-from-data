         <snippet>There's something both simple and sweet about Bolt, yet epic, that's entirely surprising.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bolt breaks no great new stylistic ground -- and yet it's a sturdy beaut.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bolt has the magical quality of great animation, the ability to touch us without the hint of preachiness or manipulation.</snippet>

         <snippet>What keeps Bolt fresh is an unaffected exuberance, a genuine sense of fun, that is expressed above all through obsessive attention to craft.</snippet>

         <snippet>As Bolt, John Travolta is inspired: His voice still cracks like an adolescentâ€™s, and he has the perfect dopey innocence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bolt carries two tales for the price of one, both handled by Disney veterans and first-time directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard with wit, grace, and the dazzling craftsmanship we've come to expect from the studio that's hitched its wagon to Pixar.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a Disney film, so there's never any real question regarding Bolt and his friends' ultimate success or failure, but the writing team of Dan Fogelman (Cars) and co-director Williams (Mulan) have concocted one of the most witty and often hilarious Disney outings in years.</snippet>

         <snippet>While this charmer about a canine James Bond does not pack the emotional punch of "WALL-E," it's frisky fun to see the white shepherd get a new leash on life.</snippet>

         <snippet>This winning mix of exciting action, heart-tugging sentiment, and gentle character comedy makes Bolt yet another solid addition to Disney's history of family-friendly fare.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's doubtful that audiences go to animated features to hear movie stars talk. They go because a film sounds like fun and something their kids and maybe they themselves might enjoy. Bolt is all that and more.</snippet>

         <snippet>This stuff is clever, in the reflexively satirical, self-aware way that many animated films are. It's not until the dog is accidentally shipped off to New York City that the movie lets you in on an altogether more interesting idea: It doesn't want to be that cool.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a terrific tenderness in Travolta's performance, while Cyrus and company are similarly effective.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bears some telltale signs of Pixar's trademark smarts, but still looks like a mutt compared to the younger company's customary purebreds.</snippet>

         <snippet>As the voice of Bolt, John Travolta does a fine job and Disney star Miley Cyrus is fine as well, but neither one can overcome the lack of personality in their scripted characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Travolta does a nice job, but Bolt is of course the most boring, blandly cute character in the movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has that formulaic, cookie-cutter feel typical of many Disney toons. The premise is inspired, but the follow-through is merely adequate.</snippet>

         <snippet>As sprightly and determined as its fuzzy, yappy lead, the new Disney animated film Bolt works hard to be all things to all people, with mixed results.</snippet>

         <snippet>The unlikely superhero of this film is the hamster, who brings the funny amid a flurry of weaker gags. But Bolt still has charm -- it just won't hit with the adults the way the best animated films can.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though every frame is great to look at, Bolt's script - by the co-writers of "Mulan" and "Cars" - lacks the wit of its closest Pixar relative, "The Incredibles." Rhino and some goofy pigeons provide the few laughs once the tale goes cross-country.</snippet>

         <snippet>Taken on its own terms, Bolt the movie certainly makes the cut.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bolt is just too knowing; it keeps reminding us, loud and clear, of how culturally savvy it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Adults won't find much to enjoy here, though the dog's high-octane action series serves as a perverse parody of Jerry Bruckheimer-style summer blockbusters.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>It's a seriously withholding action comedy, stingy on the wit, charm, jokes, narrative satisfactions and animals with personalities sharp enough for the big screen, either in 2-D or 3-D.</snippet>
