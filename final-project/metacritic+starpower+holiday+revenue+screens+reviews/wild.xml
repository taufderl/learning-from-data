         <snippet>It has a good director, snazzy visuals and some really funny animals, and that's at least half the battle.</snippet>

         <snippet>The voice performances are terrific, particularly those of Belushi and Garofalo, as the amorous squirrel and the giraffe he would like to have as his wife.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is the third animated feature in a row (after "Curious George" and "Ice Age: The Meltdown") which aims at children and has no serious ambition to be all things to all people, i.e., their parents. But for kids, it's OK.</snippet>

         <snippet>The CGI characters seem less like artwork than humans wearing animal suits, but despite the overall ugliness and sitcom timing, this has enough action, violence, and invention to keep kids amused.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the kids are giggling at gambling pigeons and psychedelic chameleons, parents can enjoy a screenplay sensitive to the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. In The Wild, the most valuable weapons are honesty, tolerance and the ability to be oneself.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Wild roars back from a rocky opening act to a storming last reel, just managing to claw its way above comparisons with "Madagascar."</snippet>

         <snippet>Adult humor in kiddie films -- of which there is plenty in The Wild -- is not only welcome but, for many adult viewers, essential.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lifting a concept isn't exactly foreign to the world of animation (what's "The Lion King" if not "Bambi" with manes?), but it isn't often a rip-off gets as blatant as The Wild, a flat-out regurgitation of "Madagascar."</snippet>

         <snippet>The Wild suffers from a breakneck pace that seems to exist only so that director Steve Williams can earn his nickname of "Spaz."</snippet>

         <snippet>Kids under 6 will dig it - though the alligators and wildebeests might scare them. Certainly they scared this groan-up.</snippet>

         <snippet>A decent-looking and harmless computer animated film that is notable mostly because it doesn't appear to contain a single original idea.</snippet>

         <snippet>As far as story is concerned, the whole thing feels like a rerun of a raucous Saturday-morning television show aimed at hell-raising five-year-olds.</snippet>

         <snippet>Under Steve "Spaz" Williams' direction, the animation is exquisitely detailed, down to the lions' individually moving whiskers--but when's the last time you enjoyed a cartoon for its realism?</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is a relentlessly loud and ultimately exhausting exercise only partially leavened by the usual heavy doses of wisecracking humor and visual gags.</snippet>

         <snippet>Uninspired character animation and obnoxious banter aside, The Wild  is ultimately done in by the persistent stench of been-there-seen-that.</snippet>

         <snippet>How's the movie? Technologically incredible, aesthetically pretty hideous, and narratively lumpy: Kids who aren't cynics (i.e., 9 and under) will roll with it.</snippet>

         <snippet>These films take years to produce, so The Wild isn't exactly a ripoff - but it isn't exactly fun, either.</snippet>

         <snippet>There may be nothing new under the sun, but there are at least films that dress up old tropes in new ways. This isn't one of them.</snippet>

         <snippet>Janeane Garofalo is all wrong as the giraffe, whom the animators contort into all manner of weird positions so she can share the frame with pint-size love interest Benny the squirrel (Jim Belushi).</snippet>

         <snippet>The animation is cheesy; the banter isn't funny; the score is noisy and grating; and the critters look like stuffed animals. The best that can be said for The Wild is that it's a most insincere form of flattery. The worst is that it's a sincere form of theft.</snippet>
