         <snippet>The film is effective in its intimate moments as well as its violent set pieces, and it could attract audiences, primarily because of Spacek's superb performance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Garity, son of Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden, gives the kind of performance rarely seen in today's movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>A respectable and fairly decent movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>The astonishingly inept finish could serve as a primer in screenwriting classes on how not to wind up a family drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story is as impersonal as it is labored.</snippet>

         <snippet>All the performers are fine--even the miscast Romijn--but they're still too much like actors playing dress-up.</snippet>

         <snippet>The only thing saving Lake City from total ridiculousness is Spacek.</snippet>

         <snippet>Added to the general torpidity and twangy tropes of this Southern family drama is the discomfort of watching a natural actor (Garity) force it.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of those Deep Dark Secret movies, the dull indie Lake City combines a wholly uninteresting family mystery with a wholly unconvincing crime drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Only natural spitfire Spacek, as the pickup-driving mom of the land, feels fresh. There's even a mouthy kid Garity is "taking care of" - guess whose son he is?</snippet>

         <snippet>Feels like a movie whose story was slapped together during filming. Its three phases -- Southern pastorale, Sudsville and Kablooie -- donâ€™t really connect.</snippet>

         <snippet>Moore and Hill's script plunges Spacek in a mawkish stew of banality and improbability composed of bits and pieces of earlier roles.</snippet>
