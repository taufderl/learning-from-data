         <snippet>If you're content to let dream logic take over, a lot can be gleaned from this odd, darkly funny meditation on life, death, love and revenge.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie, which has the slightly glum perversity of early Chabrol, is a dream of betrayal, with the squirmiest attack-of-nature tableau since Willard.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rampling has a relatively small role in Lemming, but the 60-year-old star proves the high point of the suspenseful black comedy from France.</snippet>

         <snippet>By the end, you may not know whether you've seen a ghost story or a story of delusional obsession, but you'll have had a great time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like Michael Haneke's "Caché," this effectively creepy little customer from Dominik Moll (With a Friend Like Harry) fires yet another shot across the bows of French bourgeois complacency, while throwing in a wink and a nudge about the perils of surveillance.</snippet>

         <snippet>The acting is serviceable and primarily of the stare-until-you're-uncomfortable variety, although Rampling is much more than that: She's a classic screen temptress with the aura of a melancholy spider.</snippet>

         <snippet>Spooky, intellectually titillating and darkly funny picture is definitely the kind of film where the less you know going in, the better.</snippet>

         <snippet>Exhilaratingly anxious, Dominik Moll's new film Lemming charts familiar territory but does it with gravity and panache.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is much more intriguing in its dread-inducing opening half, when Moll's assured direction keeps suggesting that something horrible will be happening soon, then, when it does, that something even more horrifying may follow.</snippet>

         <snippet>Begins like a house afire and then fizzles out into a quasi-supernatural dead end.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's main attractions are the Charlottes, but the price of watching their eerie psychological pas de deux is to endure muddled metaphors and goofy gadgetry.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lemming does possess a mordant humor as it watches characters spin out of control. But the payoff is slight.</snippet>

         <snippet>The score is the most effective thing about the film. Sometimes it's a suspicious, mischie-vous distraction from the reality that not enough of this makes sense.</snippet>

         <snippet>The second half of the movie squanders suspense and momentum, solving its riddles by deflating them.</snippet>
