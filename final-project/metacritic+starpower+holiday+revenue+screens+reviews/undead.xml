         <snippet>What really grabs your attention about Undead, however, are the effects. For a movie budgeted under $1 million, the Spierigs have done an amazing job putting together believable visuals.</snippet>

         <snippet>This gory, ghoulishly funny horror goof is shameless fun in its own right.</snippet>

         <snippet>Precociously inventive horror pic that combines brain-eating zombies with outer space aliens.</snippet>

         <snippet>A campy, low-budget Romero homage that's badly in need of editing.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's nothing under the goofball gags and gushing gore, and its welcome is worn out well before it's over.</snippet>

         <snippet>It gets duller and duller as it turns out to have used up all its amusing tricks in that first 30 minutes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Initially artsy, then campy, then tense, it would have worked better if writer-directors Peter and Michael Spierig had kept everything serious and let the inherent absurdism of zombie attacks speak for itself without additional ironic comment.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, the film is a stale, derivative mess that borrows heavily from every zombie and alien movie worthy of imitation, to only ho-hum effect.</snippet>

         <snippet>The over-the-top tone gets stale awfully quickly -- especially once it becomes clear that it's all wacky style over any real attempt at substance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Flesh-eating fish notwithstanding, Peter and Michael Spierig's low-budget schlock-horror parody brings precious little new to the undead genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story is more undead than all of these revenant shufflers. And the orgy of gore and home-engineered special effects doesn't make up for the shortfall.</snippet>

         <snippet>However visually striking, this Australian film is ultimately as tedious as it is derivative.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching it is a smidgen like listening to the same monkey-walks-into-a-bar joke for the 105th time, but for the Spierig brothers, it is clearly a demonstration of fast-cheap capabilities and a one-way ticket straight out of Queensland.</snippet>

         <snippet>If only they didn't cannibalize their source material so much, then take an extreme rule reversal just before the end credits, they might have achieved something original, rather than just a fan-fiction derivation of George A. Romero's canon.</snippet>

         <snippet>On the level of a no-budget student film in which the shots barely match up into sequences. It's about as much fun as watching blood dry.</snippet>
