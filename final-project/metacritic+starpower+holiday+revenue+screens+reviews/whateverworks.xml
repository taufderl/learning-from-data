         <snippet>No kidding: this is the feel-good movie of the year and a cinematic soul massage.</snippet>

         <snippet>What makes Whatever Works so enjoyable, aside from the unusually high number of effective one-liners the script contains (this is Allen's funniest movie since Mighty Aphrodite), are its supporting characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Easily one of the loosest, most satisfying comedies to hail from the prolific writer/director in a while.</snippet>

         <snippet>At one and the same time it feels like a decent-but-not-great film of his '70s period and a perky and tart entry in his modestly successful revival in the last half-decade. Neat trick.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ends up being a pleasantly surprising blast from the past, a delightful and amusing touchstone to Allen's comedic prime.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a slight-but-enjoyable effort, and it features something a little on the surprising side: an optimistic ending.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though Clarkson acquits herself reasonably well in a terribly conceived role, her entrance interrupts David’s hilariously twisted mentorship of Wood and sends the movie careening in a far less promising direction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whatever Works feels like something out of time and, worse, out of step. Hell, Allen wrote the script back in the 1970s for Zero Mostel.</snippet>

         <snippet>There was always a dreaminess in his vision of the city, but now it feels as distant as the polished floors and the Deco furnishings of the Fred Astaire movies that Boris finds--of course--whenever he turns on the TV.</snippet>

         <snippet>The fact that Allen wrote the script in the '70s explains something about why his newest movie feels so old.</snippet>

         <snippet>This far-fetched, deliberately artificial game of musical chairs -- in which mismatched characters encircle, attract and repel each other -- feels forced, often losing itself in excess verbiage.</snippet>

         <snippet>As Whatever Works creaks along, the attention-getting nastiness of the first half dissipates and it turns into just another Woody Allen overacted sex farce. Of all the insults hurled about in the film, perhaps the worst is its pandering conclusion. What exactly does Allen take his audience for? A bunch of mindless zombies?</snippet>

         <snippet>While the film is slightly better than similar efforts Allen made between the ’90s and his recent time in Europe, it’s both too broad and too shallow.</snippet>

         <snippet>Most disheartening of all is that, after shooting four films in a row abroad, Allen seems to have lost his feel for New York locations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whether you want to trace this romance back to "La Strada" or Allen's marriage to Soon-Yi Previn is your business, but on-screen it never registers as more than a writer's conceit.</snippet>
