         <snippet>Among the sunnier, funnier films of the year, thanks largely to the zest with which Faris embodies a mental vacuum.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is basically on one level and Faris on another -- in that exclusive aerie occupied by Judy Holliday, Carole Lombard, Lucille Ball and a few other blissfully original comedy goddesses.</snippet>

         <snippet>A blissfully broad comedy that should catapult Anna Faris into a singular kind of stardom.</snippet>

         <snippet>This particular wheel hasn't been reinvented, but at least it gets a nice fresh coat of bubblegum-pink paint and a star to pilot it with aplomb.</snippet>

         <snippet>The picture is sharp, in a warm, fuzzy way, about the ways women can sometimes inflict cruelty on other women in the name of feminism. Feminism doesn't have to be the enemy of kindness, but sometimes -- alarmingly often -- it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bunny is fashioned as a bawdy comedy with heart, but its reliance on formula undercuts the amusing moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie also has some embarrassing laugh-free stretches, but Faris holds everything together with bubbly intelligence, unexpected line readings, and a few deft pratfalls.</snippet>

         <snippet>So haphazardly written and directed that it barely qualifies as a movie, The House Bunny is watchable solely for the comic stylings of the blond veteran of the "Scary Movie" series.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite a winning performance by Anna Faris, the cutest thing in platform shoes since Goldie Hawn, the film falls on its keister so many times that before long the perky pinkness turns bruising black-and-blue.</snippet>

         <snippet>This empty-headed comedy about a Playmate who finds herself a house mother to a group of misfit sorority sisters is little more than a recycled version of "Legally Blonde" with bunny ears.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yes, from "Blonde" to "Bunny," it's abundantly evident that the two scribes have mastered, truly mastered, the serious art of self-plagiarism.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, Ms. Faris has neither an adroit script -- House Bunny is a stale collection of dumb bunny jokes -- nor Ms. Witherspoon's wily charm. And the filmmakers do Ms. Faris no favors by inviting comparisons to Marilyn Monroe.</snippet>

         <snippet>The resulting hodgepodge of unfunny, sophomoric humor and PG-13 T&amp;A, frosted by a sheen of appallingly nauseous "drama," makes for such a noxious brew that it's amazing viewers stay in their seats for the entire production.</snippet>
