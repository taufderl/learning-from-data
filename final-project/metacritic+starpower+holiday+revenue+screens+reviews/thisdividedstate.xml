         <snippet>The 25-year-old filmmaker takes no sides himself. Wisely, he allows folks of all opinions to put their feet in their mouths all by themselves.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a fascinating, infuriating story, and despite the fact that Greenstreet occasionally wanders off subject it's a brave and highly commendable effort that's chock-full of chilling moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>Greenstreet's film at least serves as a reminder of how useless public debate becomes when everyone's screaming and no one's listening.</snippet>

         <snippet>Greenstreet captures all the hubbub on film but, while he makes the point that we are indeed a house divided, he can't quite persuade us that this particular situation is a metaphoric example of our national malaise.</snippet>

         <snippet>This Divided State will become yet one more largely forgotten cinematic footnote to an election notable for its divisiveness.</snippet>
