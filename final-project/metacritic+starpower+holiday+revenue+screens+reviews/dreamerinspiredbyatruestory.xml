         <snippet>Thebest sports movies aren't really about sports. Dreamer has a few thundering horse races, but its finest moments are beautifully still ones, like the one in which a little girl peeks through a fence to give a lame filly a Popsicle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mom (Elisabeth Shue) suffers from the fatal movie ailment of being so underwritten she's practically see-through.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nicely run through its paces by John Gatins, who also wrote the screenplay (it's his directing debut), Dreamer is, not surprisingly, about daring to dream the big dreams. It's about family, and faith, and facing hard times together.</snippet>

         <snippet>Russell, who looks younger with each movie, holds his own against the formidable force that is Dakota Fanning.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sometimes stumbles into the trap of excessive predictability. But its amiable (and largely fictionalized) heart tugging still makes for charming all-ages entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is as corny as it sounds, and yet not half as cloying and sentimental as you expect. At the end of the day, the horse may win the race, but the fate of the American heartland looms large and unresolved.</snippet>

         <snippet>The low-key charm of its setting underscores the easygoing performances of a relaxed, well-matched cast. Kristofferson doesn't oversell the grizzled grandpa routine or talk down to the little girl.</snippet>

         <snippet>It manages to be a watchable, even enjoyable movie about and for girls, and in our world of candy-coated sparkly pink c---, that's a rare and commendable thing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just rent the kid ''National Velvet" when you get home. That movie's proof you don't need a true story to be inspired.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fanning and Russell are a perfect, sweet-and-sour pair. And, of course, the horse is absolutely beautiful - which, in the end, is what this all comes down to, anyway.</snippet>

         <snippet>Follows a formula, but the formula, when applied with skill and intelligence, as it is here, is pretty much foolproof.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a sports drama -- a genre that's gotten entirely too much play lately -- "Dreamer" is singularly unexciting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dreamer is a kids' movie. It offers the simple black-and-whites of innocence, with no grays to add complexity.</snippet>

         <snippet>I was not disappointed by Dreamer, the most dishonest movie I've seen in a while. Nobody gets a fatal disease before the end credits, but every other clich? is exploited in this fabric of impossibilities, nonsense, stereotypes and shameless tear-jerking.</snippet>
