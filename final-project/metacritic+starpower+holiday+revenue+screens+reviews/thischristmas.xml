         <snippet>This Christmas is the rare movie about a cozy household at holiday time that's as funny and dramatic and poignant as any seasonal family get-together should be.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's warm, witty and alive, with a fantastic cast and a belief in its characters that transcends its formulaic tendencies.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's surprising is how well Whitmore, the director, manages to direct traffic. He's got one crisis cooling, another problem exploding, a third dilemma gathering steam and people exchanging significant looks about secrets still not introduced. It's sort of a screwball-comedy effect, but with a heart.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everyone in this madly good-looking clan has got soapy problems as befits an aspirational, say-amen holiday movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's different from the usual fare in one obvious way -- most of the cast are African Americans -- and, more importantly, in its willingness to leave some problems unsolved and volatile or unhappy people unchanged.</snippet>

         <snippet>A rare holiday treat, a package that's both thoughtfully selected and sure to please its intended recipients.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a big, gushy, emotional, secret-driven, family-obsessive casserole, perhaps facile in some of its resolutions, but so full of good heart and love -- the real kind, which is scratchy, awkward, difficult to express and doesn't conquer all but just some -- that the movie is difficult to resist.</snippet>

         <snippet>"Christmas" won't wow anyone with its audacity or originality, but it's bound to make plenty of people happy with its slick, crowd-pleasing familiarity.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of those overstaffed, overstuffed "when do we eat?" holiday dramedies. Call it a double-extra-strength episode of "Soul Food."</snippet>

         <snippet>So full of solid performances and appealing characters that I wished writer/director/producer Preston Whitmore (“The Walking Dead") had considered the dictum “less is more."</snippet>

         <snippet>No matter how silly the situation, each member of the uniformly strong cast creates a nice balance between sentimental and sweet - which is just how every holiday gathering should feel.</snippet>

         <snippet>Writer-director Preston A. Whitmore II throws enough soap opera for an entire TV season into a story that nearly -- but not quite -- sinks from the weight of all these implausible events. Animated acting and the sheer chaos of this squabbling family give the film a comic buoyancy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Boisterous and bittersweet, the film is not dull, but it does feel hopelessly overstuffed, with scant time to devote to any one story line.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not a bad movie, per se. It's just harmless and bland and dull and predictable, and sometimes that's worse than a bad movie.</snippet>
