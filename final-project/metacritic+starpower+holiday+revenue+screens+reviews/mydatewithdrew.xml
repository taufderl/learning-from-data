         <snippet>Any film that can make you cringe at it's honesty, laugh at it's insanity and yet follow along hook line and sinker is something special.</snippet>

         <snippet>Viewed through the right lens, "My Date…" succeeds as a warm, heartfelt story about childhood crushes and the pursuit of lifelong dreams. (Through another, it's downright unnerving.)</snippet>

         <snippet>There are times, to be sure, when Herzlinger's antics threaten to swing from cute to cloying. But the few missteps are gently redeemed by an unexpectedly charming finish.</snippet>

         <snippet>Functions as much as a primer on how to conduct underground filmmaking as it does an offbeat romantic comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The documentary My Date with Drew is "Don Quixote" meets "Bowfinger" meets "Swingers" for the reality-TV generation.</snippet>

         <snippet>It plays less creepy on-screen than it sounds, at least in part because Herzlinger is an extremely likable guy and he goes to great lengths to avoid appearing to be a stalker.</snippet>

         <snippet>This maddening yet deftly made, and finally disarming, documentary comes through with enough heart and hilarity to sell its celebrity-stalking shenanigans to genuinely moving effect.</snippet>

         <snippet>As trivial as the micro-budget documentary My Date With Drew may seem, it has novelty on its side, and even when that flags, it coasts along on sheer personality.</snippet>

         <snippet>When our hero finally does get his moment in the sun--c'mon, would someone have bought the movie if he didn't?--My Date With Drew offers the surreal spectacle of pursuer and pursued pleasantly gabbing, obliviously immersed in a mutual PR stunt.</snippet>

         <snippet>As his movie-in-progress goes along, his pursuit of a childhood dream looks increasingly like an excuse by a canny aspiring filmmaker to create a work sample.</snippet>

         <snippet>Uou may choose to read My Date with Drew several different ways -- as endearing or frightening, as bleak or expectant, as the optimistic daydream of the naïve Everyman or the beginning of a problem that could only lead to a restraining order.</snippet>

         <snippet>In this TV reality show masquerading as a movie documentary, Brian Herzlinger is a creepy voyeur, a run-of-the-mill loser who obsesses about living the celebrity high life but lacks the talent to pull it off.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's most grating, though, is how the film pretends to be an inspiring story about one ordinary guy's pursuit of a quixotic dream to meet his muse, when in fact Herzlinger's adoration of Drew is considerably less heartfelt than his infatuation with himself.</snippet>
