         <snippet>Embry and first-time actress Sparks have charming chemistry, but Christopher's slight screenplay wears out its welcome long before the film - which runs a scant 80 minutes - is over.</snippet>

         <snippet>Promising new writer-director Mark Christopher is like "Dollhouse" director Todd Solondz's more cheerful little brother.</snippet>

         <snippet>The kind of little indie you'll either hate or find impossible to resist. I fall into the latter camp, but can appreciate opposing views.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not for all palates, but it's laced with enough tasty ingredients to sustain a following. Scribe/helmer Mark Christopher has crafted a bittersweet, persuasively acted comedy whose tone recalls '80s teen films.</snippet>

         <snippet>A small-scale character piece that genuinely likes its protagonists: an overweight teen girl and an overage delivery guy. But for all its quirky touches, the comedy cleaves to formula in its depiction of how they challenge and change each other.</snippet>

         <snippet>Christopher delivers cutesy jabber and one-note characters, as oily and devoid of substance as... well, you know.</snippet>

         <snippet>The tone is half mocking, half forthright and completely boring.</snippet>

         <snippet>An ugly-duckling fable populated with grotesques out of John Waters, Pizza attempts an unlikely mode: earnest camp.</snippet>

         <snippet>At the end of her spontaneous date, she says it's been the best night of her life. It will not be one of yours.</snippet>
