         <snippet>Director Rosser Goodman makes the crucial decisions facing Trevor suspenseful and involving -- and tinged with humor as well as pathos.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sometimes succeeds, but mostly comes off as a vanity project for writer-star Brent Gorski.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gorski's script is full of catty gay banter, especially hilarious when delivered by Jay Brannan (Shortbus) as the hero's promiscuous best friend.</snippet>

         <snippet>There isn't enough by way of a story here to keep director Rosser Goodman and writer-star Brent Gorksi earnest but lethargic drama about a romantically stalled Angelino from petering out as well, but some decent performances from the likeable cast may be enough to hold your interest.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's nothing to fill up the 88 minutes of the film except for the idle bitchery spewed by nearly every character.</snippet>

         <snippet>This portrait of 20-something gay men and their straight friends is a joyless exploration of middle-class deadbeats (with the exception of Ephram) lost in a torpid funk of low self-regard. Because theyâ€™'e not rich, there is no sleazy zing of "Less Than Zero"-worthy glamor.</snippet>
