         <snippet>The interviews Bitton conducts, almost all with Arabs and Jews who share her despair, are less meaningful than what she captures in silence: the sight of farmers separated from their farmland, everyday people thwarted in their dailiness, and children playing next to what looks like prison walls.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its opponents, Arab and Israeli alike, the "wall" is a dispiriting symbol of apartheid and defeat.</snippet>

         <snippet>An important human and artistic testament -- a calm meditation on something no one can consider calmly.</snippet>

         <snippet>The French filmmaker Simone Bitton takes a measured look at the barrier in her documentary Wall, a film that considers hard-core political realities alongside agonizing personal truths.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of the most interesting and two-sided films to be made about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lingers too long on wordless, symbolic shots of the wall itself. But there's no denying the power of seeing two cultures standing so helplessly on opposite sides of a single fence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bitton is Frederick Wiseman-obsessive about the practical details that make this horrific arrangement work, but she's also an unabashed polemicist.</snippet>

         <snippet>Helmer -- an Arab Jew who has lived on both sides of Jerusalem and is comfortable speaking idiomatic Arabic and Hebrew -- is particularly well qualified to tackle her subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Bitton engages in some penetrating conversations, and shoots some artful video footage, Wall never really tops its first scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>While all this might have made for a potent short subject, the abstract visual monotony begins to wear thin shortly into the 98-minute running time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Coming and going through the wall's checkpoints is a tiresome and undignified process that makes US airport security look like a cocktail reception.</snippet>
