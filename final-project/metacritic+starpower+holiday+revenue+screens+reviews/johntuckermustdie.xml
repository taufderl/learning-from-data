         <snippet>A slumber-party classic that belongs on the same shelf as "Bring It On" and "10 Things I Hate About You." This high-school comedy should do for its 20-year-old star, Brittany Snow, what those movies did for Kirsten Dunst and Julia Stiles.</snippet>

         <snippet>Surprisingly entertaining, if less than original.</snippet>

         <snippet>Betty Thomas, directing a script by TV veteran Jeff Lowell, seems uncertain whether to sympathize with her three heroines or with the title cad, but there's something mildly charming about this cheerful revenge comedy's lack of any straightforward moral agenda.</snippet>

         <snippet>A briskly-paced, refreshing kick in this season of draggy, two-hour-plus movies. The film is smarter and funnier than its trailers indicate, and, as a bonus, there are no superheroes, pirates or Wilson brothers to be found.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although mixing teen humor with sentiment will never be done as well as in "American Pie," John Tucker Must Die has just enough heart to entertain the "MySpace" set.</snippet>

         <snippet>The performers are a bright bunch, especially Snow (even if she's no sane person’s idea of a wallflower), Metcalfe, who has the cocksure swagger of a young Travolta, and McCarthy, who infuses her few scenes with a haggard dignity masquerading as optimism.</snippet>

         <snippet>Revenge movies often end with the message that vengeance is empty and futile, but it's never encouraging when revenge seems pointless from the start.</snippet>

         <snippet>Penn Badgley is wildly charismatic in the role of John Tucker's younger brother. The entire picture could hang on his cheekbones alone.
If only Mr. Metcalfe shared his talents.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too cute by half, the high school comedy John Tucker Must Die is just so likable, so, um, cute - in that helpless-bunny-wabbit sort of way - that to diss it would be to admit being a heartless, cynical Bambi-killer.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie starts out cleverly enough but grows insipid as the girls' antics become more predictable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is as inconsequentially pleasant as its star, and far nicer than the title lets on, too.</snippet>

         <snippet>A load of formulaic nonsense that should still turn a few young heads thanks to its fantasy plot and Jesse Metcalfe's chest</snippet>

         <snippet>But despite doing its best to jiggle, giggle and ogle its way into a niche somewhere between "Heathers" and "American Pie," it becomes just another forgettable pastiche of sight gags and pop-culture references.</snippet>

         <snippet>John Tucker Must Die is toothless. The jokes are obvious and unfunny, the storyline goes nowhere that's interesting or unexpected, and the only chemistry happens in a science lab.</snippet>
