         <snippet>Rebound is about as unmotivated as Coach Roy, doing nothing to distinguish itself from any other movie ever made about winless teams that learn to stop losing.</snippet>

         <snippet>The whole thing feels like a half-day of community service, which Lawrence walks through good-naturedly.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rebound is a sports comedy so by-the-numbers that you don't really have to watch it -- you can just check in on it every once in a while between trips to the concession stand and the bathroom.</snippet>

         <snippet>It'd be tempting to accuse Rebound of neutering Lawrence, but the sad fact is that Martin Lawrence doesn't have a whole lot of comic genius to betray.</snippet>

         <snippet>I can't recommend the movie, except to younger viewers, but I don't dislike it. It's "Coach Carter" Lite, and it does what it does.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Carr, who helmed the similarly predictable "Daddy Day Care," keeps things moving, both on and off the court, with the sort of light, sweet humor you're not likely to find in too many other summer movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rebound is determinedly lightweight fare that shamelessly resorts to every crowd-pleasing cliche it can think of to wring sympathy and laughs from its audience. To say it succeeds is not meant as a compliment.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's just another bland, junior-high-basketball riff on "The Bad News Bears" formula, one that takes every single dramatic cue from the underdog sports-movie playbook.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even without surprises, or drama, or clever dialogue, or even a single scene of any merit, Rebound goes along pleasantly.</snippet>

         <snippet>Short on laughs, if supremely inoffensive, this sleepy nonentity of a movie finds Mr. Lawrence in his huggable teddy bear mode.</snippet>

         <snippet>The players fall into recognizable stereotypes: the big and clumsy kid, the real talent who's also a showoff, the buffoon, the gross-out guy. But no one is more formulaic than the coach. He starts out smug with the kids and ends up smitten.</snippet>

         <snippet>Viewing the new Martin Lawrence kiddie movie is more enjoyable than watching my dog eat a desiccated toad carcass he pried off the road, but only marginally so.</snippet>

         <snippet>The funny-looking kids steal every scene from Lawrence, simply by virtue of being funny-looking kids.</snippet>
