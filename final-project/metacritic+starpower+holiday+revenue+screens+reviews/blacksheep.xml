         <snippet>It manages the weird feat of making a flock of sheep bounding across a meadow seem vaguely menacing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never very frightening, but it's clever and fun, with a memorable amount of humor and gore.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cast, including Tammy Davis as a handyman and Glenis Levestam as a housekeeper with a taste for innards, hits its marks flawlessly, even when the material isn't first-rate. Like "Shaun of the Dead," Black Sheep is at once exhilarating and self-deprecating, knowledgeable without being fannish, clever but not too clever.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cartoonish overkill that often makes Black Sheep a hoot proves wearying over an entire movie: The broad comedy and one-note characters eventually cancel out the horror, leaving elaborate set pieces that are more frantic than funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>A giddily subversive addition to the age-old cinema tradition of the horror comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once you have seen a sheep munching on a bloody human leg, you may think twice about your next leg of lamb. On the other hand maybe you'll be inspired to seek vengeance. To provoke one of these responses -- vegetarianism or a defiant meat eating -- may be the point of this odd, amusing film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Both the humor and horror are as broad as the side of the Oldfields' barn, but King and the cast are clearly having fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a one-joke skit that trots in a straight line, and your enjoyment of it will depend entirely on how many times you need to see gonzo sheep rip out human entrails.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, Black Sheep takes so long to get going and misses so many easy opportunities for classic comedy it has to be regarded as a noble failure.</snippet>

         <snippet>The gold standard for the modern monster movie remains "Tremors," which combines genuine thrills with clever plot twists and distinctive characters. By contrast, Black Sheep has a bunch of one-note living jokes running around willy-nilly while being chased by killer sheep.</snippet>

         <snippet>I did like seeing the (fakey-looking) sheep take flying neck-high leaps at various human throats, in scenes recalling the killer rabbit in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." And I enjoyed the Kiwi dialects. And I suspect King's next film will be better.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stunning vistas of New Zealand's rolling countryside aren't enough to carry this lame 2006 horror spoof.</snippet>
