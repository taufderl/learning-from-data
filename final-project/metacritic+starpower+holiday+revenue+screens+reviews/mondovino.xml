         <snippet>The highest praise I can give to Mondovino is that it makes you want to sample every vintage it shows you.</snippet>

         <snippet>This cagey and compelling 2004 documentary looks at the world of wine, but it's actually a nuanced, provocative piece of journalism about globalization and its discontents.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite its visual restlessness and its dogs, Mondovino is a fascinating film.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's nonetheless a fascinating, thirst-inspiring, thought-provoking journey. Just one request for the lengthier version: fewer shots of dogs' swimsuit areas, please.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's no question where filmmaker Jonathan Nossiter's sympathy lies, but he makes his case leisurely, without hysteria and with much playful screen time devoted to the various interviewees' pet dogs.</snippet>

         <snippet>The real subject, though, is how globalization fosters a homogeneous, "same-old-stuff" conformity that molds almost everything on the planet into an ever-shrinking number of shapes, sizes, and varieties.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nossiter has an eye for stray details and a knack for relaxing his subjects- although the scene with the naked guy trampling his own grapes may make you sorry that you ever gave up drinking Ripple.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie feels incomplete and uncentered. It's like a grand magazine profile that's all reportage and absolutely no prose.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you have a serious interest in wine and the Â­patience for this kind of rangy, undisciplined filmmaking, you'll learn something. But you'll have more fun at a winetasting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mondovino is repetitious. The version that is being shown here runs 131 minutes and would be more effective with about twenty minutes of condensation.</snippet>
