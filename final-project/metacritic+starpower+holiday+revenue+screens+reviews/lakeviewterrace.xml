         <snippet>I find movies like this alive and provoking, and I'm exhilarated to have my thinking challenged at every step of the way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lakeview Terrace isn't literally about the riots, but it's still one of the toughest racial dramas to come out of Hollywood since the fires died down--much tougher, for instance, than Paul Haggisâ€™s hand-wringing Oscar winner "Crash."</snippet>

         <snippet>As a thriller it's solid three-star tension. As a Samuel L. Jackson showcase it proves a man can only coast through so many motherfuckin' or milquetoastin' turns before having to display his full and overpowering talent.</snippet>

         <snippet>A conventional suspense thriller, but the details kick it up a notch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Here's a vote of gratitude for Samuel L. Jackson, who has become a specialist in making mediocre movies far more entertaining than they should be.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lakeview Terrace holds your interest, though the bad faith on all sides makes it something of an endurance test.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a shame, then, that the later stages of Lakeview Terrace should overheat and spill into silliness. The plot is compromised, not resolved, by the pulling of a gun.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like a lot of better genre fare, Lakeview Terrace uses its predictable premise to mount a stealth attack on the audience's sensibilities.</snippet>

         <snippet>In pandering to Hollywood standards about how stories like this should unfold, LaBute has lost his edge.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jackson modulates Abel's internal turmoil and heated exchanges with enough shades of loneliness, steely generosity and wicked playfulness to give the actor firm control of our fascination and growing unease.</snippet>

         <snippet>The main problem with this treatise on racial politics undercover as an exercise in suspense is that the director, Neil LaBute, didn't write the script.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>A passable piece of hackwork, with some adequately suspenseful passages and a few mild shocks near the end. But the psychological dimensions of the story are so risible, and its supposed insights into race and class so wrongheaded and ugly, that irritation trumps enjoyment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Grabs a fistful of hot-button story elements -- race, sex, politics -- and promptly mixes them into the thriller equivalent of tapioca.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately, Lakeview Terrace isn't about race so much as it's about being a man, which has been LaBute's fallback theme from the start.</snippet>
