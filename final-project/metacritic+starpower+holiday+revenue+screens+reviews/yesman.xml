         <snippet>Starts out wobbly but ends up quite nicely, primarily because Carrey has a wonderful acting partner in Zooey Deschanel.</snippet>

         <snippet>Carrey's most satisfying live-action effort since "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."</snippet>

         <snippet>This is basically a nerd-loosening-his-tie romantic comedy done in the manic-compulsive mode of "Liar Liar."</snippet>

         <snippet>Of all the roles where the star has played a character transformed from ordinary to goofy ("The Mask," "Me, Myself &amp; Irene," "Liar Liar"), this is the one where he seems the most human, achieving that elusive quality in a Carrey film: tolerability.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like many previous Carrey vehicles, the point of this one directed by Peyton Reed is that one should not live at the extremes, but should achieve a balance between low and high, no and yes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Genial but slim, picture is certainly a light-hearted alternative to weighty year-end awards bait, but the conceit isn't realized fully enough.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's charming enough with some nice comedy touches, but the initially intriguing premise is soon railroaded out of sight by its desire to conform to a tried-and-tested cinematic formula.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the slightly generic Yes Man is symbolic of the new, happier Jim Carrey, then it is a small price to pay for his piece of mind.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it's a star vehicle, Carrey seems only marginally interested in rehashing the role of sweet spaz, and so he almost feels miscast.</snippet>

         <snippet>The biggest problem with this movie - not that it's mediocre, dull, or barely written (though it's guilty on all counts). It's that Carrey himself is miscast.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you're thinking "yuck," you're right. I added the extra star for Zooey Deschanel, who is so delicious as his honey that you want not to say no to Yes Man.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film contains so many plugs for Warner Bros. movies like the "Harry Potter" series and "300" that it could almost double as an infomercial.</snippet>

         <snippet>This picture evaporates midway through because the story itself is a one-liner. Yet it also has a cast that gets into the silliness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yes Man puts him back in the same old quandary and, once again, Carrey lacks an identity. Alas, this time, he also lacks a script.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the movie is no more than agreeable, it does provide a swell showcase for New Zealand wundercomic Rhys Darby (Murray the hapless agent on HBO's Flight of the Conchords) and gives the astrally adorable Zooey Deschanel a rare shot at a lead role in a big Hollywood movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>An appealing Deschanel does her best, but the pair is mismatched in every way, from age to attitude. The entire movie is hung on Carrey's shtick, so if you're a fan, you'll have a decent time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yes Man rarely rises to genuine hilarity. It takes no risks, finds no inspiration and settles, like its hero, into a dull, noncommittal middle ground. Should you see this movie? Maybe. Whatever. I don't care.</snippet>

         <snippet>The first time I saw Yes Man, I thought the concept was getting kind of stale toward the end. As it turns out, that was only the trailer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even though Carrey is a bit mellower these days, the schtick feels dated. He's doing material from the '90s.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The comedy, to the extent there is any, consists mainly of Carrey's verbal asides and strained reactions to people. The script gives him very little to work with.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>With Yes Man, Carrey has bled the well dry, doing everything he knows how to do, over and over again, just to prove that he still knows how to do it. It's exhilarating to see brilliance in a comic; but by the time you start smelling it, the game is over.</snippet>
