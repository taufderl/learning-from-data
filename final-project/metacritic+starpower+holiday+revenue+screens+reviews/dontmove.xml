         <snippet>Nobody into lush melodramas dripping in sex should miss this pulsating Italian import.</snippet>

         <snippet>Told in a tricky flashback mode that's vivid even with a few too many temporal kinks, Don't Move is the sort of thing that Claude Chabrol was once praised for making with more pretension and a lot less less juice.</snippet>

         <snippet>has a rich, lyrical sweep and floats between past and present, reality and imagination, with ease. It is a richly satisfying experience.</snippet>

         <snippet>In his second outing as a director, top thesp Sergio Castellitto (also playing the surgeon) takes the viewer on an emotion-filled ride and brings a violently masculine perspective to the story. However, it is Penelope Cruz who gives the film's knockout performance.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is a mesmerizing erotic odyssey given gravity and heart by Cruz.</snippet>

         <snippet>A compelling if not altogether convincing tale of mad love and divine redemption, adapted from the prize-winning novel by Castellitto's wife, Margaret Mazzantini.</snippet>

         <snippet>A paranoid male fantasy about cheating, with surface similarities to Hollywood movies like ''Fatal Attraction" and ''Unfaithful." This one's Italian, though, and its attitude toward adultery is more European.</snippet>

         <snippet>Don't Move comes to seem as static as its title -- we just don't learn enough to compensate for feeling so little.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yes, the movie asks hard questions, but it would be better - or at least more honest - if it weren't so insistent that everyone arrive at the same answer.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is a beautifully made film - decorously composed, meticulously acted, cleanly photographed. But all of these qualities make it seem complacent and hypocritical when it wants to be honest and brave, and sentimental rather than emotionally daring.</snippet>

         <snippet>Castellitto deserves great credit for toning down the melodrama in wife Margaret Mazzantini's novel and producing a very human story about chance, choice and consequence.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's nothing cute, cloying, or playful about the lovers in Sergio Castellitto's opaque romantic drama Don't Move, but in their way, they're as incomprehensible as the stars of any gimmicky comic love film.</snippet>

         <snippet>The script is morose and unfocused - not to mention hard to believe and insulting to women.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story wants to be a sort of "Last Tango in Paris" redux, but it falls into mere melodrama after a brilliant beginning.</snippet>

         <snippet>Castellitto directed and stars in this unbearable film, a case study of a surgeon with a raging madonna-whore complex.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though sprung from the mind of a woman, the film plays like a hetero male fantasy of tortured love.</snippet>

         <snippet>A syrupy Italian power ballad along the lines of the ones on the movie's soundtrack. Its tune is mawkish, bombastic but, in the end, not especially resonant.</snippet>
