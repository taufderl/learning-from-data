         <snippet>"Queer as Folk's" Peter Paige makes a strong debut as a writer/director with this original black comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>A consistently provoking dark comedy that not only sheds light on our cynical society, but on mentally unstable people who find solace in children.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ending is a little too neat and smacks of wishful thinking, but Paige has created an engaging and insightful entertainment with considerably more substance than most small-budget, independent gay films.</snippet>

         <snippet>The politics of homophobia and child molestation receive a badly misjudged tweaking in Peter Paige's writing-directing debut, Say Uncle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Say Uncle may be trying to address gay persecution and social paranoia, but it mostly comes off as a study of arrested development. The movie's most laudable gamble is its refusal to make either Maggie or Paul sympathetic, but the moral subtleties are obscured by a one-dimensional script and a protagonist as self-centered and lacking in expression as a fetus.</snippet>

         <snippet>An acutely misguided, purported satire dealing with the prickly subject of child molestation.</snippet>

         <snippet>You'll be begging for mercy well before the end of this self-righteous, thoroughly unsavory "farce" about a lonely gay man who - gosh darn it - can't seem to stop getting mistaken for a pedophile.</snippet>

         <snippet>Laughless, pointless and downright creepy, Say Uncle is a would-be black comedy.</snippet>
