         <snippet>An animated family movie about penguins -- in the wake of "March of the Happy Feet," they're the Angelina Jolie of animals, both cute and admired everywhere. Plus, it's about surfing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Best of all is Jeff Bridges as the voice of Geek, a laid-back philosopher-penguin who becomes Cody's low-key guru, mentoring him in the ways of the wave.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not only are LaBeouf and Bridges terrific, but Jon Heder is hilarious as surfing fowl Chicken Joe. And Zooey Deschanel is saucy fun as penguin lifeguard Lani.</snippet>

         <snippet>A cut above the noisy, pop-culture joke-larded norm, and it's much more than a "Happy Feet" knockoff.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's cool but not too cool, and cute but not too cute. A neat trick considering its overexposed avian cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>A cheerful and frequently amusing bit of nonsense, which certainly will provoke children into giggles. The film does not measure up to "March of the Penguins" or "Happy Feet," both Oscar-winning efforts. Nor is it trying to.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's greatest triumph, at least on a technical level, is the amazing texture of the water, which has never looked so dramatic or convincing in an animated film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mostly, it just stands out in a crowded field of tacky also-rans by being a reasonably acceptable, more or less non-obnoxious way to spend an hour and a half.</snippet>

         <snippet>Where Surf's Up falls down is in its central relationships. (A few more jokes wouldn't have hurt either).</snippet>

         <snippet>First they marched, then they tap-danced. Now they ride the waves on souped-up boards.
It really doesn't matter what stunts they try to pull off: Who can resist an animated mockumentary in the style of "This Is Spinal Tap" starring the black-and-white big birds of the moment?</snippet>

         <snippet>The voice performances are great, particularly those from LaBeouf and Bridges, who's in a "Big Lebowski" mood. But a moratorium on penguin movies may be in order.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has a friendly, blue-collar vibe (Cody is an ex-fish-sorter from the Shiverpool, Antarctica) and some sly, low-key humor. Nevertheless, a moratorium on penguins might be called for, despite the inevitable anthropomorphic void.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's nothing terribly wrong with Surf's Up, except maybe the part where one character calls another a "dirty trash can full of poop." But the movie isn't terribly robust, either.</snippet>

         <snippet>The novelty wears off almost immediately, leaving this a real chore to watch; there's something bizarre about low-budget spontaneity being replicated in such a labor-intensive medium.</snippet>
