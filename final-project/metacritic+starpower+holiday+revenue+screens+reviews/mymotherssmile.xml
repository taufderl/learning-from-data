         <snippet>This superbly filmed Italian drama stands with Bellocchio's best work. Originally titled "Ora di religione."</snippet>

         <snippet>It's messy and unsettled, but Bellocchio's distaste for the cynicism and mendacity is potent and sincere.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the narrative is spotty, and occasionally confounding, there is an epic warmth in the way it's rendered.</snippet>

         <snippet>In his best film in years, Marco Bellocchio crafts a stringently moral tale that carries a hint of horror.</snippet>

         <snippet>"A very odd thriller" is how Italian director Marco Bellocchio describes My Mother's Smile, his uncannily beautiful and deeply humanist exploration of the nightmares that resurface from a Roman atheist's Catholic childhood.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a bit of a mess but strong stuff nevertheless -- a mournful, often wickedly funny religious satire that suggests what Kafka might have come up with had he been raised Catholic.</snippet>

         <snippet>An artful look at religious hypocrisy, interfamily dynamics and the way people wrestle with personal history long after the original events are over.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are many nuances to My Mother's Smile, not all of them evenly told. Yet even when the conversations sound absurd, the film never fails to captivate.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, Bellocchio suggests in this spiritual thriller that perhaps faith is the dream from which we do not awaken.</snippet>

         <snippet>At the last, My Mother's Smile conveys that, if Bellocchio is just doggedly hanging on to a career, he is still able to make us feel nostalgia for those high Italian days.</snippet>

         <snippet>As absurd as the situation gets--and the film occasionally launches into surreal asides that only heighten the absurdity--director and star both keep it grounded in the situation's emotions.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the central role, Castellitto's powerfully focused performance manages to keep the complex drama grounded.</snippet>

         <snippet>A thoughtful, provocative film that understandably ruffled a few feathers in its native Italy -- the portrayal of the church is far less than beatific.</snippet>
