         <snippet>Escapist fun that provides an effective showcase for the blue-collar charisma and bulky good looks of its hyper-athletic lead, four-time World Champion wrestler John Cena (think Matt Damon, only twice the size).</snippet>

         <snippet>Derivative it may be, but with its echoes of "Speed," "Lethal Weapon" and "Die Hard With A Vengeance," this is a welcome throwback for audiences raised on '90s action flicks -- what they used to call "a pulse-pounding roller-coaster thrill-ride of a movie."</snippet>

         <snippet>There's something strangely charming about films that are all artifice, explosions, and naked calculation. 12 Rounds is at least honest trash: It never pretends to be anything other than manic schlock.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is the kind of amiable time-killer that belongs on a basic-cable weekend afternoon.</snippet>

         <snippet>You will probably find yourself praying for this duel's knock-out punch to arrive long before it actually does.</snippet>

         <snippet>I defy you to hate John Cena. Really. You can try all you want, but I don't think you'll make it.</snippet>

         <snippet>As one of the WWE's marquee pro wrestlers, John Cena is some actor. As a straight actor . . . he's a great wrestler.</snippet>

         <snippet>Noisy, cut into a head-snapping blur with little room for Cena to even try showing emotion, 12 Rounds is an occasionally exciting but always empty experience.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are, as you may have guessed, 12 rounds of this arbitrary nonsense. Annoying as the conceit may be, it neatly functions as a means to gauge how much is left to endure.</snippet>

         <snippet>12 Rounds is the unholy stepchild of "Die Hard with a Vengeance" and "Speed," starring a man whose lack of range makes Steven Seagal seem nuanced by comparison.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cena is no Jason Statham. His stolid seriousness sucks the life right out of any scene in which he's required to speak. It's a bad sign when you repeatedly wish a runaway trolley would silence the hero.</snippet>

         <snippet>The viewer, even from a seated position, deserves a championship belt for surviving this overlong actioner.</snippet>
