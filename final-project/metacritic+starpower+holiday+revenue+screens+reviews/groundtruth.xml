         <snippet>The documentary any American with an opinion on our involvement in Iraq owes it to his or her conscience to see.</snippet>

         <snippet>This film, a raw howl of outrage and pain, is proudly one-sided, allowing a generation of wounded men and women to scream their betrayal.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wrenching new documentary about returning veterans, may not single-handedly reverse the trend of ignoring Iraq docs in theatrical release, but it should.</snippet>

         <snippet>Foulkrod's film is not about taking a political side, though it is clear she is strongly opposed to the war in Iraq. Her focus instead is on the dehumanizing of eager young men and their transformation into killing machines.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's become a critical cliche to say that everyone in the U.S. should see a particular war documentary, but even the most selfish citizen might want to check out The Ground Truth, because unlike the Iraqi victims of the war, the American ones are all around us.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mostly a string of talking-head interviews, but those talking heads -- more than 16 men and women -- are compelling.</snippet>

         <snippet>This thoughtful, sensitive film, perhaps the most emotionally wrenching of all the Iraq documentaries, could have been made after any war.</snippet>

         <snippet>The substance of the movie is potent, and so powerfully presented by those who have fought and are still fighting a controversial war, that the message of Ground Truth cannot be dismissed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Far from being a mere polemic, The Ground Truth is bolstered immeasurably by Foulkrodâ€™s almost exclusive use of interviews with actual veterans.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tries to do too much in too little time. It would be a stronger film if it devoted more detailed attention to the plight of the returning veteran. As it stands, it is a scattershot antiwar polemic that doesn't bolster its arguments with any historical perspective or statistical evidence. No one from the government or the military is trotted out to give an opposing view. This is not to say that The Ground Truth, on its own terms, isn't devastating.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Ground Truth is an emotionally potent work, but the great study of an Iraq vet, in either documentary or fictional form, has yet to be made.</snippet>

         <snippet>The details are eye-opening (or ear-opening, in the case of marching songs taught to the new Marines about slaughtering Arab schoolchildren), but soon Foulkrod's film backs itself into a Support Our Troops corner.</snippet>
