         <snippet>Despite a third-act tendency to gather a few spare genre clich√©s as it rolls along (Guns! Drugs! Angry siblings!), Robinson's film is a cut above the rest.</snippet>

         <snippet>Robinson has assembled an impressive young cast comprised primarily of rappers (such as Tip Harris, a.k.a. T.I.) and fresh faces (newcomer Lauren London).</snippet>

         <snippet>Fresh and unexpected. It feels like a real window on the lives of disenfranchised youths - these are in South Atlanta - as they make their way in a society that doesn't cut them any breaks.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film mostly avoids easy laughs or simplistic characters, reminding you how few black movies claim the huge middle ground between chardonnay-sipping buppies and hardened criminals.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story is familiar, but terrific performances and a vivid sense of place elevate it above the average teen-oriented picture.</snippet>

         <snippet>An emotionally charged coming-of-age saga that will make you laugh and cry, maybe at the same time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Buoyed by a superlative soundtrack, ATL plays a familiar song about growing up, but hits notes that sound brand new.</snippet>

         <snippet>Notwithstanding the melodrama and the often ham-handed directing, ATL somehow works. A large part of this is thanks to Robinson's skill in evoking the hickory-smoked flavor of the ATL.</snippet>

         <snippet>The more rink time, the better: As directed by hip-hop music-video king Chris Robinson from a story by "Antwone Fisher's" Antwone Fisher, the skate scenes are a blast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Working from a story by Antwone Fisher, screenwriter Tina Gordon Chism is tender toward characters balancing where they come from with where they'd like to go. Fisher was the subject of an inspirational biography by Denzel Washington.</snippet>

         <snippet>Is ATL even a hip-hop movie? There's hip-hop in it, certainly, but unlike the recent vehicles for Eminem and 50 Cent -- respectively, ''8 Mile" and ''Get Rich or Die Tryin' " -- it does not have a rapper hero.</snippet>

         <snippet>What starts out as a lively reconsidering of the thug-life mentality ends up having as much depth as, well, one of Robinson's videos.</snippet>

         <snippet>House definitely put a smile on an insider's face, but outsiders can enjoy the ATL too. The only prerequisite here is the ability to laugh.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately, the film could stand to be more inconsequential, because whenever anything happens to move the story along, it immediately loses its laid-back Southern charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's first half hour is a barrage of lazy narrative pointers--endless expository voice-over, freeze frames and captions to identify the numerous characters--and by the time screenwriter Tina Gordon Chism decides to write an extended scene, the story is already dead in the water.</snippet>
