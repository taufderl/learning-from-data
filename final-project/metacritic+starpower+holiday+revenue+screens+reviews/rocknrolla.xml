         <snippet>Ritchie concocts a crime-jungle demimonde that's organically linked to the real world, and it's a damn fun one to visit.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's all here: the ingenious, obscenity-laced language, the double crosses that turn into triple crosses, the swaggering characters so in love with themselves. GottaLove RocknRolla!</snippet>

         <snippet>A cleverly constructed, sensationally stylish and often darkly hilarious seriocomic caper.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sharp comedy as well as a punk-pulp spree. Don't go if you can't handle Brit slang. ("Grass" = informer.)</snippet>

         <snippet>The bottom line is, all these people chase the same money around with the success of doggie tail-biting, and it's a lot of fun, and it's not often in these con films that everybody is conning everybody, and they're all scared to death, and nobody knows which cup the pea is under.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the plot has a few too many holes in it, the sheer fun of RockNRolla makes it easy to overlook such quibbles. Butler will make you forget all about "Sparta."</snippet>

         <snippet>Although the characters are all cartoons, Ritchie still invests them with enough personality to make them stand out as real people, which is what makes RocknRolla much more involving than your typical Tarantino ripoff.</snippet>

         <snippet>The main problem is that Ritchie keeps playing the same old song. It's a swell tune, and we don't mind hearing it every few years, but we'd welcome another subject in a transposed key. Even the Material Girl tries out fresh material.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you're a fan of the early Ritchie comedy-crime thrillers, then this is not only right up your alley, it's a long lost relative returning home.</snippet>

         <snippet>As is the norm for Ritchie, Rocknrolla is also too long, too coolly violent, and too populated by characters who all talk like they've been reading the same pulp novelist.</snippet>

         <snippet>A fast-paced amoral joyride that's more interested in the absurdities of violent criminality (torture by crayfish, anyone?) than the complications of real life.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching Guy Ritchie's British-underworld farce, RocknRolla, is like being compelled to pay attention to a nonstop rock station you normally use as background while you're doing chores. The words are catchy and the beat keeps you awake, though all of it quickly fades.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's fun to see Tom Wilkinson, for instance, with a massive bald spot virtually eating scenery with a knife and fork.</snippet>

         <snippet>A well-acted and attitudinal action movie, a return to Ritchie's trademark "Mockney" style, which takes amusing and twisted turns.</snippet>

         <snippet>RocknRolla is a kickass crime drama that just doesn't know to quit while it's ahead.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ritchie whisks you along on a whirlwind tour, but he's not averse to putting on the brakes long enough to admire some of his favorite attractions.</snippet>

         <snippet>It never generates much interest in its story or affection for its characters, and it's simply not half as funny as it needs to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like the filmmaking itself, the violence has no passion, no oomph, no sense of real or even feigned purpose.</snippet>

         <snippet>On the plus side, the actors - especially Butler and Wilkinson - work overtime to pump some extra life into the self-conscious script.</snippet>

         <snippet>RocknRolla is a copy of a copy of a valuable original, and you know how faint and unintelligible those can be.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thinking back on watching these performers, I see them mostly as an arrangement of bewildered actors awaiting orders, as if Ritchie hasn't bothered to tell them what he needs them to do. Heâ€™d sure make a lousy Mob boss.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ritchie, who shoots and cuts everything in RocknRolla like an ad for a particularly greasy brand of fragrance for men, delivers the beatings and killings in his trademark atmosphere of morally weightless flash.</snippet>

         <snippet>RocknRolla attempts to depict a world of ever-expanding chaos. But the chaos is only in the way the story is told. The actual vision Ritchie offers is pedestrian and tame.</snippet>
