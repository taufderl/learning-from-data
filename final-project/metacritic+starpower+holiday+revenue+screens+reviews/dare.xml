         <snippet>A smart and well-observed entry in the genre, is a cut above the usual hijinks.</snippet>

         <snippet>As it develops, Dare lays out some interesting psychological puzzles, though the filmmakers lack the technique to explore them as thoroughly as you might wish.</snippet>

         <snippet>A high school coming-of-age film that dares to push the envelope. It doesn't always succeed, but that's not for lack of trying.</snippet>

         <snippet>Think of the film from director Adam Salky and screenwriter David Brind as "Pretty in Pink" crossed with "Cruel Intentions."</snippet>

         <snippet>The film lacks the comedic charm of "American Pie," but with its dark, hyper-sexualization of teens, it offers an engrossing if not soap opera-esque tale of self-discovery.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dare, a sweetly sexed-up high school triangle movie, is like a John Hughes comedy trying to pass itself off as ''transgressive.''</snippet>

         <snippet>This "Cruel Intentions"-style cesspool of teenage hanky-panky may be more scandalous than its chaste Disney counterpart, but that doesn't necessarily make it any more authentic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zach Gilford's game performance is still no match for the film's catalog of easy ironies, awkward framings, and advice on how to play Blanche DuBois.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thereâ€™s one bright spot amid all the awkward groping and abundant onscreen texting, and his name is Zach Gilford.</snippet>
