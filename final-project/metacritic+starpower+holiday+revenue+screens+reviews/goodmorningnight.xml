         <snippet>Combining a thoughtful script with splendid acting -- especially by Sansa -- Bellocchio has fashioned a tense thriller that is both understated and powerful.</snippet>

         <snippet>Numerous filmmakers have attempted to dramatize the terrorist activity that gripped Italy in the 1970s, but few have done so with the unsettling power of Marco Bellocchio's Good Morning, Night.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bellochio, who began his career in 1965, has made some of the most trenchant Italian films on political themes, and Good Morning, Night is one more of them.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a thoughtful and ultimately chilling take on a tragedy that still has the power to disturb and divide.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bellocchio's film, which enlivens the grim realities of months in a stuffy apartment with striking bursts of lyricism, is often a powerful cautionary tale about the dangers of becoming a slave to ideology.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a strange and murky movie, at times a frustrating one, but I also found it profoundly moving in a way no regular thriller ever is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like its oxymoronic title, Good Morning, Night is sober yet filled with fancy. There's a wistful aspect to the movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>At times Good Morning, Night feels as claustrophobic as the apartment itself, and you may feel that the director is handling his volatile material with a bit too much delicacy. But the movie's atmosphere is a curious mixture of obliqueness and intensity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though he doesn't possess the dangerous confusion of his tragically misguided heroes, veteran director Marco Bellocchio does share their capacity for raising thought-provoking points that end in an ineffectual tangle.</snippet>

         <snippet>The writer-director's inquiry into this tragedy makes for a moving and intelligent film, but the dark story never feels fully realized.</snippet>

         <snippet>It has been called both detached and loaded, unfairly slanted as well as balanced by some of its critics--I can only testify that I found the film both troubling and absorbing over two separate viewings.</snippet>
