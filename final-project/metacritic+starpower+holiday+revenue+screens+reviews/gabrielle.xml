         <snippet>Together with his extraordinary performers, Mr. Chéreau breathes life into characters who long ago set a course for death.</snippet>

         <snippet>If all this potent drama recalls Bergman, the beautifully articulated staging and setting suggest that master of operatic social-sexual drama, Luchino Visconti ("The Leopard").</snippet>

         <snippet>A period chamber drama drawn from a Joseph Conrad short story and of such intensity and passion that it transcends a specificity of time and place to achieve timelessness and universality.</snippet>

         <snippet>In Chéreau's hands, Gabrielle has an operatic quality that throws the repressive environment into sharp relief; the film works like a pressure cooker, seething with bottled passions that intermittently burst through with startling cruelty and violence.</snippet>

         <snippet>A haunting and riveting work, unlike anything else you can see at the movies and as such an explicit challenge to the unambitious, anesthetic character of most contemporary cinema. But is it easy, or delightful, or fun? It is not.</snippet>

         <snippet>At once robust and ethereal, this is an existential ghost story, with fresh blood pulsing through its veins.</snippet>

         <snippet>Patrice Chereau's portrait of a marriage en crise is an excoriating look at the deep unhappiness that can fester within the most respectable-seeming of households.</snippet>

         <snippet>Greggory anchors Gabrielle in manly bewilderment and rage, while Huppert claws the title character's way to self-awareness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Huppert and Greggory provide the emotional impact. They respond accordingly, imbuing their mutual suffering with an exacting and moving finesse.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's impact has a lot to do with Fabio Vacchi's original score, which is both plaintive and coldly modernist, with echoes of Charles Ives.</snippet>

         <snippet>So much of this adaptation is engrossing that the script's additions are jarring.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gabrielle, a quietly insidious tale of domestic warfare that makes the protagonists of Bergman's "Scenes From a Marriage" look like pussycats, will exasperate and satisfy in roughly equal measure.</snippet>

         <snippet>This highly stylized portrait of a loveless marriage at the beginning of the 20th century merges a claustrophobic theatricality with dazzlingly cinematic wide-screen compositions (the sumptuous cinematography is by Eric Gautier).</snippet>

         <snippet>Gabrielle inspires mixed feelings; it is dialogue heavy but a treat for the eye.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it won't appeal to everyone, the concoction actually works, thanks to Huppert and Greggory's powerful negative chemistry.</snippet>

         <snippet>Chereau keeps us locked inside their suffocatingly unhappy home, making for an intensely theatrical chamber piece.</snippet>

         <snippet>This looks and sounds superb. Isabelle Huppert and Pascal Gregory are splendid. But the over-archingly smug sophistication of the enterprise robs it of some much-needed human interest.</snippet>
