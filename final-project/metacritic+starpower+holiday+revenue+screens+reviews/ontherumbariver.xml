         <snippet>Works best when it sticks to the musical performances, which Sarin films in lengthy scenes built from extreme close-ups of lips, fingers and sweaty skin.</snippet>

         <snippet>You don't have to be a fan of African tunes to appreciate On the Rumba River, Jacques Sarasin's heartfelt ode to Congolese music and its resilient practitioners.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's great strength is its performance footage.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a filmmaker, Sarasin has an extraordinarily light touch--a good thing for those who want to sit back and enjoy the music (the toe-tappingly spirited rendition of Wendo's biggest hit, "Marie-Louise," is a highlight), a bad thing for viewers unfamiliar with Congolese history and in need of a little context with their rumba.</snippet>

         <snippet>Delightful music alternates with too-brief interviews with Wendo and his colleagues. On the Rumba River cries out for narration to help viewers understand the tragic context of his life.</snippet>
