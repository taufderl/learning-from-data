         <snippet>A smart, sharply observed, highly affable look at contemporary relationships that finally injects a little life in the stagnating genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>If a movie that uses the word "relationship" 7,000 times puts your teeth on edge, stay away.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cast, however, is great -- Crudup and Duchovny in particular share a fun chemistry that's just toilet-obsessed enough to be absolutely believable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film makes coupling look less like bliss and more like an exhausting series of skirmishes that can send one party scurrying into infidelity or out the door in search of something better.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its strength is its humor, which is half-"Seinfeld" and half-"Sex in the City." There's a reason why those shows ran for only 30 minutes each - it's difficult to sustain comedic momentum for longer, as becomes apparent here.</snippet>

         <snippet>Freundlich's intelligent, very funny take on male-female relationships manages the not inconsiderable feat of being both jaded and appealingly fresh.</snippet>

         <snippet>A botched adult romantic comedy that strands its leading player, and its audience, in a wearying, sitcom-slight battle of the sexes.</snippet>

         <snippet>A relationship dramedy wields little power without an emotional punch. And when the theatrical (literally) climax attempts bold emotionality, one canâ€™t help but wince.</snippet>

         <snippet>Trust-- and the genre itself -- needs to dump the stale formula and embrace reality and reinvention.</snippet>

         <snippet>The actors gamely keep up their spirits, but the male characters are too one-dimensional and the female characters too bizarrely divorced from reality to be at all engaging.</snippet>

         <snippet>It wasn't so bad, aside from the god-awful ending; at the very least Freundlich manages to come up with funnier jokes than the ossified one-liners decorating Allen's recent movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>For those who appreciate the Woody Allen view of New York but would prefer fewer neurotics, Trust the Man provides a loving take on bourgeois Manhattan contentment that's usually only found in episodes of "Will &amp; Grace."</snippet>

         <snippet>Trust the Man could easily carry the following subtitle: "Men Who Behave Like Petulant, Spoiled Children and the Women Who Decide It's Easier to Love Them As-Is Than To Try to Turn Them Into Grownups."</snippet>

         <snippet>Trust The Man presents itself as a funny, insightful Manhattan relationship comedy in Woody Allen mode, but morphs into the phoniest of Hollywood rom-coms.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has some good laughs courtesy of its cast -- but they're basically papering over a script that's masquerading as urbane and trenchant, when it's really self-involved and didactic and more than a little foolish.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The cast tries hard and a sprinkling of laughs results, but the project is defeated by a concept that is not very novel, a script that is not especially witty, direction that is neither sharp nor insightful and one-note characters that are simply not very interesting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ms. Moore is nicely lighted, but she too is poorly served by Mr. Freundlich's unfunny, unfocused screenplay, which basically stitches together a series of short scenes of four people whining in various combinations.</snippet>
