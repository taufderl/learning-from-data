         <snippet>Absolutely exhilarating...Pound for pound, it's more kinetically thrilling than anything Hollywood has produced in years, not least of all because it's real.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's fascinating to watch others sweat, suffer and triumph in the documentary Dust to Glory, which chronicles the longest nonstop, point-to-point race on our planet.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like his father, Brown inserts himself into the action via folksy narration. His husky, laid-back voice sounds something like Kevin Costner, lending a regular-guy aura to the reverential treatment he affords his subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its exceptional multicamera coverage and dynamic editing, pic provides an amazing ride across the dusty roads and stunningly varied terrain of what could be the world's most demanding vehicle race.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everyone seems to think that this crotch-rocket rumble is the equivalent of invading Normandy. "We're a band of brothers," says one racer. No, you're a band of boys, competing to see who has the longest camshaft.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are more over-the-top moments, but they never last long. And after every groan-inducing piece of footage, a spectacular near-crash or daring motorcycle chase comes along to leave the movie's shortcomings in a cloud of dust.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brown lays out his guiding philosophy up front when he says of the Baja, ''This isn't about a race, it's about the human race."</snippet>

         <snippet>The action is exciting, but the rapid-fire narration jumps around too quickly, making it difficult to keep straight the personalities meant to hold the film together.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brown probably captures enough to satisfy hardcore enthusiasts, but everyone else might end up wondering why he ignored the glory for the dust.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is occasionally some gorgeous scenery, and the challenge of driving through silt is mildly interesting.</snippet>

         <snippet>The swooping helicopter shots, the POV camerawork from the front seat of a 800 hp trophy-truck and the propulsive soundtrack will have your heart racing towards the finishing line along with the drivers.</snippet>

         <snippet>The single most impressive thing about the film, in fact, is the taste that this shotgun technique gives of the mass simultaneity of the race.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite the scenic appeal of Mexico's Baja Peninsula, the film may prove too nerve-racking for casual viewers. It is a racing movie for the inside track.</snippet>

         <snippet>You'd better be in the mood for a blitz of bumper-sticker philosophy, a major machismo transfusion and 94 minutes' worth of mind-numbing repetition, complete with a musical score seemingly lifted from reality TV.</snippet>

         <snippet>But where there is a natural poetry of motion in surfing movies, off-road racing is a herky-jerky pastime whose Â­appeal is hard to fathom. I guess you had to be there.</snippet>
