         <snippet>A glorious blend of kitsch, grit, humor and uplift.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fukada captures the stubborn individualism of a girl who embraces an unpopular lifestyle.</snippet>

         <snippet>A silly, freewheeling, candy-colored lollapalooza, but also heartfelt.</snippet>

         <snippet>A charmingly loony tale of two young loners who form an unlikely bond, this droll Japanese import puts the predictable banality of most Hollywood teen flicks to shame.</snippet>

         <snippet>The yummy Japanese confection Kamikaze Girls deserves both a better title and an audience to go with it.</snippet>

         <snippet>For the Western viewer, the cultural divide acts as a saccharine filter, and Kamikaze, a cult hit in Japan, becomes a mesmerizing lesson in otherness.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's the kind of rollicking rebel-chick flick that should score well in venues that appreciate Quentin Tarantino films.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wears out its welcome at 100 minutes, but could find an audience in the West as a latenight attraction at gay fests.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fluff. The cinematic equivalent of too much cotton candy Tetsuya Nanashima's Kamikaze Girls is a hyperkinetic fun house ride that is about forty five minutes too long.</snippet>

         <snippet>What Kamikaze Girls doesn't have is a plot. As nice as the film looks, it soon grows tiresome -- though I could listen to the Johann Strauss II soundtrack forever.</snippet>

         <snippet>But it's all done with such high style and whizzes along at such an exhausting pace that you probably won't have enough time to notice how little you care.</snippet>

         <snippet>For this viewer, the climactic scooter-gang rumble, heavy on plot twists and empowerment speeches, felt eternal, but for many, the happy silliness of the film's first half should carry the day.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nakashima does his best to keep the flimsy enterprise afloat, mostly through whooshing camera movements and headlong dives into the grotesque extremes of Japanese kitsch. By the end, the effect is like eating a bellyache's worth of cotton candy.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you value plausibility in movies, skip Kamikaze Girls; this is the sort of picture where getting run over by a truck gives a character gorgeous hair instead of a broken hip.</snippet>
