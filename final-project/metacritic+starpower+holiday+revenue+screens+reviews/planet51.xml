         <snippet>Delivers a few pleasant surprises, including a smart story -- a reverse-E.T. riff that plops an American astronaut down in a world of just-like-us-only-green creatures -- and clever characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although not bowling me over, Planet 51 is a jolly and good-looking animated feature in glorious 2-D.</snippet>

         <snippet>Largely, it’s a jellybean of a movie: bright, colorful, sugary, and with no real content.</snippet>

         <snippet>This movie, which was made by an animation studio in Spain, isn't trying to make a social statement; it speaks in the international language of lightweight comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a missed opportunity. The premise is OK enough, even if it is like one of those old "Star Trek" episodes.</snippet>

         <snippet>An uninspired computer-animated feature that may satisfy undiscriminating pipsqueaks and nearly no one else, Planet 51 is a low-IQ E.T. in reverse.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie as a whole isn't exactly ground-breaking, and some of the humor tanks. But it has enough action, laughs and candy-hued visuals to satisfy the target audience without plunging grown-ups into despair.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps Planet 51 should have added a dash of Pedro Almodovar, one of Spain's preeminent directors.</snippet>

         <snippet>Movie references abound, but there's not enough humor to fuel even 90 minutes.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's nothing funny, provocative or involving about what "Shrek" co-writer Joe Stillman and the team from Madrid-based Ilion Animation Studios do with the notion here.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like "E.T." in reverse, this pleasantly mediocre CG animation tale lands an astronaut on a distant planet.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yet the moral at the end is that we should all be more tolerant of different cultures. Is that really true, though, if the culture you're trying to tolerate is trying to open your skull with a circular saw?</snippet>
