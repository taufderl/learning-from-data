         <snippet>This is a Holocaust movie that is so relentlessly observed and so aware of woe that it never feels like it belongs to a genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>This exceptional film features some of the most beautiful cinematography ever seen on film, in service of some of the most horrible images imaginable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fateless is a strangely beautiful film, enhanced by a typically lyrical Ennio Morricone score and by Koltai's hazy, grayed-out images.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the juxtaposition of cataclysmic matter-of-fact misery and cinematic poetry, the filmmaker finds a calmly stunning way to convey the experience of living with death as something intimate, and, unnervingly, almost natural.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like "The Pianist," Fateless painstakingly builds up the reality of what it is like to be drawn into a perfectly arbitrary hell you can neither comprehend nor rationalize.</snippet>

         <snippet>Koltai is an accomplished, Oscar-nominated cinematographer (for 2000's "Malena"), and Fateless is meticulously composed and shot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fateless is both haunting and poetic. It also is visually stunning.</snippet>

         <snippet>It represents something stranger and, to those of us with only a secondhand or thirdhand knowledge of that history, more disturbing: a survivor's conviction that there were aspects of the experience itself that can only be described as beautiful.</snippet>

         <snippet>Exquisitely modulated and superbly mounted, the directing debut of skilled cinematographer Lajos Koltai went through an extended, unpredictable production history to emerge as a genuinely new way of looking at the Holocaust that is markedly different in tone from other such stories including "Schindler's List" and "The Pianist."</snippet>

         <snippet>Fateless has a remarkable absence of sentimentality. The movie is obviously artistic, but there are no cheap or superfluous effects. It's almost mystically translucent.</snippet>

         <snippet>It contains little that will be new to any informed viewer; yet it fascinates for all of its 140 minutes.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a work that sears the heart and conscience. The events are annihilating, the way they're told both beautiful and terrifying.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fateless looks man's inhumanity to man square in the eye and pronounces it standard operating procedure, and that may be the greater horror.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film never lacks dignity. Fateless doesn't look at life at the camp like Roberto Benigni did in "Life is Beautiful."</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's power also lies in the honesty of its observation. Though Gyuri survives unfathomable horrors, he can't forget them and, in the end, doesn't want to. They're the only history he has.</snippet>
