         <snippet>A B-movie-style throwback that’s consistently diverting and blissfully free of morals and messages, A Perfect Getaway is just the thing for the summertime movie blahs: it’s a genuinely satisfying cheap thrill.</snippet>

         <snippet>A clever, heart-pounding thriller, and a welcome return to form for the director.</snippet>

         <snippet>Benefits from one standout performance: Timothy Olyphant ( Deadwood ) plays the part of Nick with ingratiating comic relish.</snippet>

         <snippet>The plot will require some discussion after the film is over. Is it misleading? Yes. Does it cheat? I think not. It only seems to cheat. That’s part of the effect. All’s fair in love and war, and the plots of thrillers.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Perfect Getaway is never great, but Twohy isn't aspiring for greatness--he's after gritty and lively and weird. And that's good enough.</snippet>

         <snippet>To Twohy's credit, he does a decent job of keeping you guessing -- and interested -- until almost the very end.</snippet>

         <snippet>A big-reveal thriller with surprises that really do surprise -- and are worth waiting for through an audaciously long buildup -- A Perfect Getaway finds writer-director David Twohy in popcorn form with a muscularity not seen since 2000's "Pitch Black."</snippet>

         <snippet>While A Perfect Getaway, like "The Sixth Sense," recaps itself, to indicate to the audience what they may have missed (and when), there seems to be plot holes large enough that one could paddle through them in an outrigger canoe.</snippet>

         <snippet>Writer-director David Twohy (Pitch Black) serves up mechanical thrills culminating in a bogus twist ending.</snippet>

         <snippet>Steve Zahn makes full use of the many varieties of hyper in his acting arsenal, while Timothy Olyphant has a heckuva good time telegraphing macho mania.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even if you know what’s coming, it’s a neat bit of meta-thriller filmmaking, as much about the mechanics of storytelling as a reasonably satisfying example of it.</snippet>

         <snippet>When the story’s twist arrives,  you half-expect Twohy to throw in a couple of reels from "Dead Again," plus outtakes from "The Usual Suspects." It’s a lulu; I'm just not sure if it's the sort of lulu that will lead to great word-of-mouth.</snippet>

         <snippet>Twohy serves up a hard-to-swallow second-act twist and an unconvincing back story, but the slightly overlong A Perfect Getaway recovers with a pulse-pounding climax.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a low-brow, psycho-on-the-loose-in-paradise thriller, A Perfect Getaway is surprisingly entertaining.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's still a gimmicky, tricked-out tale that is all too self-aware. But the film does keep you guessing and probably guessing wrong.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Perfect Getaway is, in its own delightfully silly and manipulative way, one of the most effective paranoid thrillers of the new millennium. That doesn't make it a great movie by a long shot.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result isn't deadly dull, but it does turn what should have been a most dangerous game into a basic scenery-chewing contest.</snippet>
