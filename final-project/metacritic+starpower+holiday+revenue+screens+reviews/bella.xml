         <snippet>The movie is a little more lightweight than the usual People's Choice Award winner at Toronto, but why not? It was the best-liked film at the 2006 festival, and I can understand that.</snippet>

         <snippet>A tearjerker that earns its sobs with heartfelt emotions.</snippet>

         <snippet>May have more heart than head, but it's also just as interesting for what it leaves out of its romantic story as for what it retains.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bella is, indeed, a beautiful film. The bustling, cab-crowded thoroughfares of New York City have rarely looked as inviting and the coastline as momentously beachy as they do in this film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mexican-born helmer Alejandro Monteverde's debut will be remembered as a curious case of a mediocre film that wows crowds.</snippet>

         <snippet>The melodrama and cheap theatrics of the story’s off-center segments drag the whole thing down.</snippet>

         <snippet>Certainly a sweet, life-affirming picture, but it's just not authentic or captivating enough to justify its wildly concocted scenario.</snippet>

         <snippet>What are you going to do when your lead actress offers a performance that's as unlikable as the woman she's portraying? Maybe it's the script (flimsy, formulaic), or filmmaker Alejandro Gomez Monteverde's conspicuous direction, but Tammy Blanchard's Nina, a waitress with a dour disposition and an unwanted pregnancy, pretty much sucks the life out of this well-meaning melodrama.</snippet>

         <snippet>In stories like this defiantly unsubtle, structurally clunky specimen, causes women who are considering abortion to think again, and self-selecting audiences to enjoy a light, luxurious weep.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Bella (the title doesn’t make sense until the last scene) is a mediocre cup of mush, the response to it suggests how desperate some people are for an urban fairy tale with a happy ending, no matter how ludicrous.</snippet>

         <snippet>In this bilingual morality movie about love, family, and fate, however, the unpredictability turns out to be highly predictable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is more of an exercise in pandering and propaganda -- give your baby up for adoption, you selfish pig! -- than the heartfelt drama it aims to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>The emotions at play in Bella are no doubt heartfelt--and must have resonated with a few hundred people, anyway--but they're so cut-and-dried that the mawkish script virtually writes itself.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Mexican movie in which the outcome is never in doubt, the scenes are endless -- sorry, we meant poetic-- and the false beard on the central character's face looks as though it could use a little extra gum.</snippet>
