         <snippet>A surprisingly effective teen-skewing thriller that soft-pedals graphic violence (in marked contrast to the R-rated 1980 original) while generating a fair degree of suspense.</snippet>

         <snippet>Formulaic to the core, this reworking of the fondly remembered high-school slasher picture works surprisingly well on its own terms.</snippet>

         <snippet>Without the gore, this old school slasher rehash is one anemic bore.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is as listless, mindless and utterly useless a piece of corporate brain-clog as one is likely to come across for quite some time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite having the same title and a similar premise to a 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis flick (kids getting slaughtered on prom night), this is NOT a remake. In fact, it really doesn't have much of a plot. It's basically "The O.C." with a body count.</snippet>

         <snippet>Viewers' own evenings, meanwhile, will likely be ruined by unimaginative direction, inane dialogue, and Schaech's passing resemblance to Forrest Gump.</snippet>

         <snippet>McCormick and screenwriter J.S. Cardone donâ€™t have one original thought between them, but they do appear to share an obsession with characters opening hotel-room closets in which the steel hangers gleam ominously.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie offers less gore than the average Band-Aid commercial and fewer scares than the elimination episodes of "Dancing With the Stars."</snippet>

         <snippet>There's really nothing much to Prom Night: No twists, no atmosphere, no big Grand Guignol setpieces, not a single moment when it tries to do something novel with the event, the killings, the villain, or the victims. It's a little like going on a tour of the slaughterhouse, where death is meted out with mechanical regularity, but visitors are kept at a safe, PG-13 distance from all the butchering.</snippet>

         <snippet>When Jamie Lee Curtis ran from a killer in 1980's "Prom Night," she was 22 and had a unique gift for belting out fear. She was the Beverly Sills of slasher flicks. That "Prom Night" was dumb, but it wasn't insulting in the way this remake is.</snippet>

         <snippet>A nearly bloodless slasher film with fewer surprises than a broken jack-in-the-box.</snippet>
