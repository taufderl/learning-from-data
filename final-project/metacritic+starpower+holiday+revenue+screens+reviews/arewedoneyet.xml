         <snippet>It isn't gangsta, but it's winning all the same.</snippet>

         <snippet>The unchecked enthusiasm of McGinley as the touchy-feely renovation guru gives slow-burn Cube the perfect foil and mellows the malicious comic tone. The rest is pure slapstick.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a funny premise at the core of Are We Done Yet? Too bad the movie doesn't do much with it.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the latest installment avoids the nonstop parade of potty jokes, it never rises much past the level of mediocrity.</snippet>

         <snippet>After allowing sadistic violence and whining children to invade his movie like a horde of termites, Carr tries to put one over on us by tacking on a sentimental ending. But as any homeowner could have told him, you can't disguise a weak foundation with a cheap finish.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tpicture delivers the requisite number of pratfalls, and the genial Ice Cube makes for a credibly hapless everyman, but the comedy still feels a little too safely soft around the edges.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although Ice Cube is still happy to haul out his old snarl when it serves his purposes, he's clearly trying to reinvent himself as a family entertainer. But the milder he gets, the less confident he seems. What's a reformed gangsta rapper to do?</snippet>

         <snippet>An ill-advised sequel to "Are We There Yet?" and a feeble fable of better parenting through home improvement.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fans of the first film can rest assured that a change in the director's chair has done little to curb the overall tone of slapstick desperation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Supposedly based on "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House," but has about as much to do with that frothy Cary Grant confection as a Yugo has to do with a 1948 Buick Roadster.</snippet>

         <snippet>John C. McGinley from "Scrubs" gets to strut some of his comic stuff as the deranged builder, but he's the only passable feature in a property that should be condemned.</snippet>
