         <snippet>An amiably raucous, scorched-earth mockumentary.</snippet>

         <snippet>The picture repeats itself a lot, but Dash is a good sport in poking barbed fun at the PR machinations of today's music business.</snippet>

         <snippet>Well shot and edited, Death of a Dynasty is hardly a comedy classic, but it's frequently on target.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are some funny moments and amusing cameos, but it's not enough to elevate this project's slapdash approach.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dynasty is less interesting as a film than as a winking gloss on hip-hop's assembly line of beats, beefs, and B-list lyricists. That said, Capone does a killer dancin' Dash, James Toback's Lyor Cohen is a riot, and multi-credited comedian Kevin Hart should have his own Chappelleian series.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching the rest of Damon Dash's playful movie is like entering a room where a large, too noisy party is going on and never fully adjusting to the dark or the din.</snippet>

         <snippet>Inspired mockumentary-a-clef so clotted with in-jokes that it should come with a crib sheet.</snippet>

         <snippet>While those in the know will undoubtedly find something to appreciate in the film's wide-ranging if amateurish stabs at satire, the vast majority will feel left out of a private joke.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is a funny movie to be made from the outrageous egos and excesses of rap music. Death of a Dynasty is not that movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>The execution is so amateurish and the script so witless the filmmakers appear to be having a far better time than the audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mockumentary that veers unsteadily between satire and an infomercial for Dash's Roc-A-Fella records.</snippet>

         <snippet>"This Is Spinal Tap" was brilliantly funny. Death of a Dynasty? Well, the movie is just dead.</snippet>
