         <snippet>Watts is wonderful, and the story's forsaken-child theme still has plenty of horrific power.</snippet>

         <snippet>An unusually atmospheric outing. Splatter fans may be disappointed, because Nakata isn't interested in a body count.</snippet>

         <snippet>While nearly every shock comes at predictable moments, there is genuine ingenuity behind many, and the movie is surprisingly fresh for one made by a guy on his third go-round with the same material.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is as side-splitting as it is creepy, especially when it ventures into surrealistic nightmare imagery.</snippet>

         <snippet>The charm of The Ring Two, while limited, is real enough; it is based on the film's ability to make absolutely no sense, while nevertheless generating a real enough feeling of tension a good deal of the time.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>You have to admire Nakata's skill at letting the dead run free while hinting that we may have more to fear from the living. With a braver step in that direction, this middling movie would ring more than box-office bells.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watts has proven herself a Lady of the Rings, but twice is enough. No burning need for a trilogy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Isn't a great work of horror, but it's admirable simply because it serves the genre so serviceably. It's nicely constructed, and it doesn't have one of those ridiculous extended endings.</snippet>

         <snippet>Borrowing liberally from the "Exorcist" and "Omen" movies, and with little regard for credibility, The Ring Two has a familiar ring to it.</snippet>
