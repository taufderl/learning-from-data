         <snippet>Swimming Upstream evokes time and place without being showy about it and offers an altogether invigorating experience.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rush and Davis shine, and the drama is engrossingly told until it turns sadly sentimental in the last minutes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Distinguished by some unusually fine performances, but the lack of a satisfactory third act diminishes overall result.</snippet>

         <snippet>The role, one of the meatiest of Mr. Rush's career, is equal in flash and complexity to his turns as the pianist David Helfgott in "Shine" and the Marquis de Sade in "Quills."</snippet>

         <snippet>Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis, predictably impressive in the roles of abusive, alcoholic dad and troubled-but-tough mum.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rush and Davis perform strikingly against type, suffusing an otherwise average genre pic with quiet dignity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its smallness of scale, and undemonstrative nature, could make it a welcome change of pace from Hollywood bombast, especially for fans of the life aquatic.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film begins as a delicate duet between Rush and Davis, but as Rush spirals out of control, his performance becomes a flashy, over-the-top solo akin to his hammy turns in "Shine" and "Quills."</snippet>

         <snippet>Fingleton turned his own story into a feel-good fable; neither Martin McGrath's gorgeous cinematography nor the hypnotic score by Run Lola Run(1998) composers Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil's can compensate.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rush has never played anyone this starkly unsympathetic, and he proves to be very good at playing very bad.</snippet>

         <snippet>Without them (Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis), the melodramatic chronicle of real-life swimmer Tony Fingleton's formative years would have very little going for it.</snippet>
