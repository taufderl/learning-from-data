         <snippet>The director, Craig Saavedra, generates surprising warmth from the familiar tropes of the odd-couple road movie. Shooting mostly in the verdant sweep of California's wine country -- and with a superb supporting cast -- he allows Mr. Le Gros room to engage.</snippet>

         <snippet>An agreeable tone and cast make Sherman’s Way go down easy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never too dreary, Sherman's Way is a pleasant drama-comedy that's just fun to watch, much like a laid-back drive during the summer; it's not about where you're going, or how you'll get there, but just about how it feels to be in the car driving.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film simply has too many tiredly predictable elements for its own good, and despite the handsome cinematography of the extremely picturesque California locations, "Sherman's" never really finds its way.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is confidently polished, and thankfully more sweet-tempered than preachy, given that every narrative thread has an underlying theme of social injustice.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's lost-in-life meets lust-for-life in the reliably regenerative wine country, which means most moviegoers could hand this emotionally stranded odd couple a road map of where they'll be by the closing credits.</snippet>

         <snippet>Coming-of-age road trips have rarely been more tedious or predictable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plays like something out of an indie-film paint-by-numbers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, this strained comedy relies entirely on clichés and contrivances to tell the story of Sherman.</snippet>
