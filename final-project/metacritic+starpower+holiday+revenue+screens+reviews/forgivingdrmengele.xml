         <snippet>An impressively polished documentary by Bob Hercules and Cheri Hughes. Perhaps even more thought-provoking than its co-helmers intended, pic is bound to spark conversations and debate.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's hard to know whether to be impressed or appalled by Eva Mozes Kor, the Holocaust survivor in Bob Hercules and Cheri Pugh's fascinating documentary who has made forgiving the Nazis her life's work.</snippet>

         <snippet>The very title suggests that this compelling and provocative film is going to be different from other Holocaust documentaries.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kor's intentions are beyond reproach, but her campaign raises discomfiting questions.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's clear that Kor's goal is to keep people talking, and thinking, about impossibly difficult subjects. And there's no debating her success in that regard.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though some of the heated exchanges in Forgiving Dr. Mengele seem awkward and staged, they put Kor at the center of a riveting debate over how best to come to terms with past horrors, and the potential (and limits) of putting them to rest.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a film about death-camp survivors Forgiving Dr. Mengele is surprisingly uplifting and, at times, even lighthearted.</snippet>

         <snippet>This uneven but riveting documentary chronicles Kor's journey to a kind of grace little understood (or appreciated) by many fellow Jews and survivors.</snippet>

         <snippet>A worthy addition to the ever-growing canon of Holocaust-related films.</snippet>

         <snippet>In many respects, Forgiving Dr. Mengele is an ordinary documentary, stylistically and technically unexceptional. But its subject enobles the work. So does Kor : determined, indomitable, and by the end of the movie, a symbol herself of both survival and mercy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eva Mozes Kor, the lecturer and activist at the center of Forgiving Dr. Mengele, is most notable for her zeal in refusing to be a victim.</snippet>
