         <snippet>Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties is actually funnier and more charming than the first film.</snippet>

         <snippet>A genuinely clever kidpic that should delight moppets, please parents -- and maybe tickle a few tweens.</snippet>

         <snippet>When the humans have the sense to keep quiet, and the animals are doing their shtick, there's great fun to be had.</snippet>

         <snippet>The stellar array of British talent (voicing the various farm animals) and Murray (whom one suspects has rewritten Garfield's lines to be Murray-esque) give Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties all its energy and make the human actors -- even comedian Connolly -- look and sound like square panels in a two-dimensional comic strip.</snippet>

         <snippet>Two Kitties marks a considerable improvement over its predecessor. It's faster paced and the filmmakers wisely shift the focus away from bland owner Breckin Meyer and onto a menagerie of chattering animals.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is intermittently amusing, particularly when the American human part of the cast (Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt) are off-screen, the longer and farther the better.</snippet>

         <snippet>To borrow and slightly emend the words of Shakespeare: That cat will mew, but this dog will have the day.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the ''flesh,'' Garfield himself (voiced by Bill Murray) is once again strikingly unlikable, a bloated, bingeing fascist.</snippet>

         <snippet>Murray's gift for imperious indifference is the only reason to sit through a second for-kids-only movie about Garfield the lasagna-loving cat.</snippet>

         <snippet>This lifeless, talky, family-oriented feature never manages to rise to the occasion of its witty title.</snippet>

         <snippet>The predictable plot and gags make you feel like you’re watching it in cat-years, but there are a few successfully silly set-pieces that will delight kids.</snippet>

         <snippet>Something about the sequel, Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties, doesn't seem nearly as obnoxious as the original.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though Murray and Curry gamely deliver some chuckle-worthy one-liners along the way, they're mostly leashed to material as moldy and uninspired as the "Jeffersons" theme song.</snippet>

         <snippet>In a town as status-conscious as Hollywood, the embarrassment of two "Garfield" movies on your résumé must sting like the Dickens.</snippet>

         <snippet>Children will enjoy the physical humor, but discerning adults are advised to pawn their sons and daughters off on some other unsuspecting chaperone -- preferably one who doesn't read movie reviews.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Tail of Two Kitties couldn't care less about its human principals, and all it wants its animals to do is air-guitar to "Cat Scratch Fever" and wear silly sunglasses.</snippet>
