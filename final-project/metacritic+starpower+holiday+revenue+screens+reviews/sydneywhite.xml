         <snippet>The result is a charmer that boldly marches where lesser movies - at least since the heyday of John Hughes - fear to tread.</snippet>

         <snippet>"Revenge of the Nerds" is way cooler in its proud defense of geekosity, no question. But anti-ditz role model Amanda Bynes just happens to be cute.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its silly Snow White allusions aside, Sydney White is a simple but amiable modern fairy tale.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ms. Bynes, with her cherubic face, expressive eyes and comic timing, helps create a positive, pleasing diversion that caters to the geek in all of us.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although Bynes exudes a devil-may-care attitude that is fun to watch, the formulaic movie ultimately falls apart around her.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the film's premise is shamelessly hokey and Joe Nussbaum's direction is at best pedestrian, props are due the young cast, especially Bynes, whose can-do optimism seems genuine if ultimately overdone.</snippet>

         <snippet>Result should satisfy Bynes fans looking for a pleasant, innocuous follow-up to her last vehicle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Joe Nussbaum (“Sleepover”) doesn’t do much with his cast; there’s a lot of standing around as he indulges Bynes’ tendency to mug.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, though, Bynes' persistent mugging only emphasizes Nussbaum's relentlessly cartoonish direction.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all these references to the fairytale, Sydney White soon takes an easier path, recycling familiar "Mean Girls" and "Revenge of the Nerds" scenarios.</snippet>

         <snippet>Each twist and turn is so telegraphed and expected that the story feels wan and the comedy feeble.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mediocre college comedy that blends bits of "Revenge of the Nerds," "Mean Girls" and "Legally Blonde" and doesn't have much to show for it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sydney White is a carnival of ethnic and social stereotypes that are rising up against the lily-white status quo. In Hollywood, blond princesses and fairy tales die hard.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, this film doesn’t have the cojones to take the fairy tale all the way and have Rachel marry Sydney’s dad (or cast actual dwarfs). But director Joe Nussbaum knows his dorkdom, and nails it.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s cheesy and contrived, but even the most watered-down stories retain elements of the original masterpieces.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's the excuse for dumbing down Snow White to moron level? Are there really people out there who thought the original version just didn't have enough toilet jokes?</snippet>
