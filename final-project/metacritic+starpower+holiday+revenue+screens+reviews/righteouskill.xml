         <snippet>I'd like to recognize Russell Gewirtz for a screenplay that boasts humor, an impressive plot twist, and for setting up plenty of room for De Niro and Pacino to get their grooves back in order.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite how easy it would be to write off Righteous Kill as one sorry excuse for lazy filmmaking, there is still something utterly mesmerizing in the palpable chemistry between the two leading men.</snippet>

         <snippet>A twisty, turny and ultimately silly thriller from "Inside Man's" Russell Gewirtz.</snippet>

         <snippet>The entire movie is one big build-up to a twist that, while not exactly cheating, plays is an awfully cheap trick.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's astonishing how much intensity and focus these two have lost, but the picture itself is not all that bad -- if you can get the collapsing-career thing out of your head.</snippet>

         <snippet>In pairing the two icons, Righteous Kill is definitely an event. What it isn't is much of a movie. Such a waste.</snippet>

         <snippet>Righteous Kill's script is credited to "Inside Man's" Russell Gewirtz, and you wonder how the sleek, nuanced flow of that earlier movie evaded this one.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie, which has more than 10 credited producers, feels like one of those slick, for-the-money projects Hollywood studios cook up via graph charts and marketing surveys.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching these old pros play longtime buddies is a pleasure, especially since they're together in most scenes. But this thriller by Jon Avnet (88 Minutes) is mostly by the numbers, and its surprise ending, though effective, feels somewhat forced.</snippet>

         <snippet>Slack, morally ambiguous, decidedly sub-Dexter serial-killer-cop story that's been cooked up for them  (De Niro/Pacino).</snippet>

         <snippet>Unable or unwilling to match the visceral chops and moral provocations of superior serial-killer chillers, Righteous Kill is content to be a twisty genre exercise; it's like "Seven" as reimagined by M. Night Shyamalan.</snippet>

         <snippet>Instead of the meeting of maestros at the top of their form, Righteous Kill has the feeling of Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds facing off for the first time in an exhibition game. It's like Old Timers' Day at the Motion Picture Home.</snippet>

         <snippet>Under the guidance of Jon Avnet, they're (De Niro/Pacino) both playing New York police detectives - partners, no less - in the cop-and-serial-killer tale Righteous Kill, and they're thunderously mediocre.</snippet>

         <snippet>By the time the movie reaches its protracted conclusion, it feels like a slog. Pacino has a few funny lines, as does Leguizamo, but not nearly enough to save the film from collapsing under the weight of its own self-righteous tedium.</snippet>

         <snippet>Righteous Kill, a.k.a. The Al and Bob Show, is a cop flick with all the drama of "Law and Order: AARP." This movie defines drag-ass.</snippet>
