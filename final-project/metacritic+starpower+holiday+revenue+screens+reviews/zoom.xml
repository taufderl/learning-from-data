         <snippet>If August has turned the children in your life into Bored Girl and Fidget Boy, you could find worse ways to keep them entertained.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zoom suffers from following three "X-Men" movies and "Sky High," but even if it preceded them, it'd still qualify as little more than a cheap, ugly, forgettable footnote to the seemingly endless superhero boom.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tim Allen gamely brings some humanity to the role of the retired, powerless hero Captain Zoom, but is thwarted at every turn by bad special effects, slapdash editing, interminable pop-song montages, and a goofy performance by Courteney Cox.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zoom is a movie that would make Dr. Frankenstein proud. Put together with parts from so many other movies, the thing positively clanks.</snippet>

         <snippet>This tepid comic-bookish comedy should zip through its theatrical run faster than a speeding bullet. It likely won't perform much more superheroically in ancillary venues.</snippet>

         <snippet>In a feat of dullness quite powerful in its own way, this lifeless family comedy sucks the joy from every joke it touches.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of the most dismal excuses for family entertainment ever perpetrated by a major studio, this crude, lazy variation on Disney's "Sky High" (2005) revolves around the education of four "special" youngsters at the hands of a washed-up superhero.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zoom is a C-list production in every possible way, from the actors and the special effects to the music and the script. Even the product placement is completely third rate.</snippet>
