         <snippet>An average slasher picture that meanders indecisively between gore and gags.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even the gratuitous nudity can't quite save a Heathers-goes-to-college horror that's undermined by a silly plot and clunky dialogue.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's little to distinguish this from the rest of the entries coming down the horror film assembly line, though the presence of Carrie Fisher as a shotgun-toting housemother who taunts the killer by shouting "Come to mama!" offers some camp value.</snippet>

         <snippet>It lapses into that familiar category of movies that go in for lots of fancy obfuscation along the way only to make its story seem all the more simple, trite and contrived by the finish.</snippet>

         <snippet>In this breeding ground for date rape and HPV, there are some trashy kicks in seeing horrible people get theirs, plus housemother Fisher goes all buck wild with a shotgun.</snippet>

         <snippet>An interminable mess of a film that juggles more characters and undeveloped subplots than it can handle and even manages to bungle the setup.</snippet>

         <snippet>Call me the sarcastic sister, but the only things screaming in any convincing way here are the cheap look, epileptic direction and off-key, “edgy” humor. It’s all so ‘80s, I could die.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Follows the imaginatively bankrupt trend of remaking slasher films from the 1970s and ’80s. This time, it’s a regurgitation of Mark Rosman’s “The House on Sorority Row.’’</snippet>

         <snippet>Sorority Row might be utterly lacking in suspense, surprises, and wit, but nobody can say it doesn’t have a hero.</snippet>

         <snippet>The tedious flick offers little more than a few scares, and plenty of boobs. And we're not just talking about the cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brings absolutely nothing new to the autopsy table that wasn't previously covered.</snippet>
