         <snippet>At its relaxed best, when it's about, well, nothing, the slyly comic Bee Movie is truly beguiling.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kids are going to adore looking at this movie, living in it, flying through and above its brilliant landscape. It's an animated joyride over a relief map of Manhattan. I just wish the script was as good as the paint.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's not even close to Pixar standards - the animation is slapdash and the story construction's a mess - but the vibe is loose-limbed and fluky, and the gags have an extra snap that's recognizably Seinfeldian.</snippet>

         <snippet>It has enough buzzing wit and eye-popping animation to win over the kids - and probably more than a few parents, too.</snippet>

         <snippet>I'm not sure what kids are going to make of Bee Movie. The shiny, vivid computer-animated images pop off the screen with the vibrancy of the Pixar movies, but the understated, throwaway humor is pure Seinfeld: adult, observational, feasting on the small ironies of human (make that "beeish") behavior.</snippet>

         <snippet>The riskiest move Seinfeld made was to create an unlikable protagonist who is wrong every step of the way, but treat him like a hero.</snippet>

         <snippet>This candy-colored animated fable is an awkward mix of corny bee puns, clever sight gags, kid-friendly action, adult-centric workplace angst and Seinfeld's distinctive navel-gazing wit. And what's up with those four-legged bees?</snippet>

         <snippet>On the whole, this is another disappointing animated effort and it resides considerably lower on the totem pole than this year's current non-live action champion, "Ratatouille."</snippet>

         <snippet>The depth of talent in the cast and gag writing shines through, but it’s only just enough to take your mind off of the flat animation.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's more than cute, funny, and (at 81 minutes) brisk enough to move families in and out of the multiplex in mass quantities, like the social insects we are.</snippet>

         <snippet>If an animated movie isn't competing with Pixar to dazzle the eye, it had darn well better hit the heart or the funny bone. With its wee little stinger, Bee Movie misses both.</snippet>

         <snippet>Feels so slight and trivial, like a cute but small idea blown up to proportions it does not merit. A surprisingly unfunny, belabored and unimaginative comedy, Bee Movie is a huge disappointment considering the extent of Seinfeld's participation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just another ambitious, lavish animated adventure, pretty enough to look at, but ultimately foundering on the weakness of its script.</snippet>

         <snippet>Amiable but no more, Bee Movie puts a hiveful of potent talent at the service of a zig-zigging, back-of-an-envelope story that's short on surprise and originality.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film will be huge. It’s busy. It’s kinetic. It’s a treat for kids. But like much of Seinfeld’s work outside his TV show, it’s impersonal. It doesn’t come from anywhere interesting.</snippet>
