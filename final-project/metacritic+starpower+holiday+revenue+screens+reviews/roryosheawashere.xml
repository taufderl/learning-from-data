         <snippet>Buddy movies are a Hollywood staple, but Rory O'Shea Was Here puts a new and profoundly affecting spin on the tired genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>O'Donnell's directing is assured and glossy as befits a former maker of television commercials, and Jeffrey Caine's exuberant script sidesteps clich√© -- just.</snippet>

         <snippet>Better than the usual three-stage journey of courage, heartbreak and redemption. In this case, the triumph of the human spirit comes with a small bitter chaser.</snippet>

         <snippet>The kind of inspirational movie that actually earns its crowd-rousing response as opposed to merely pushing the same old, emotion-coaxing buttons.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a feel-good movie about disabled youths, Rory O'Shea Was Here gets the job done, but it isn't interesting or daring enough to make it worth a trip to a theater.</snippet>

         <snippet>A shameless heart-tugger of considerable appeal that, like many movies that start off with much going for them, could have been so much better had its makers aimed higher.</snippet>

         <snippet>A harmless little charmer with a uniformly fine cast, played by the numbers for full tear-jerking effect.</snippet>

         <snippet>A plea for equality of opportunity, a worthy objective somewhat obscured by non-disabled actors occupying the lead roles. In any case, one imagines Rory himself would prefer a Farrelly disability blooper reel.</snippet>

         <snippet>It wants to humanize the plight of the disabled, but it undermines its worthy aims by presenting its leads as martyrs and saints.</snippet>

         <snippet>The script, despite doses of irreverent humour, feels manipulative, and the music is oblivious to nuance, with a spectacular misuse of Johnny Cash singing "Hurt."</snippet>

         <snippet>Rory O'Shea Was Here gazes at the physically afflicted and just about begs for our sympathy long after we've grown restless and eager to feel something else.</snippet>

         <snippet>McAvoy does his best with this subpar, heart-tugging material. At times his mix of easy charm and inner demon pulls Rory out from under the tired script, but those pesky dramatic forces keep pushing him back in for every predictable plot development.</snippet>

         <snippet>Talented as they are, the wheelchair-bound stars of Rory O'Shea Was Here can't transcend a manipulative script.</snippet>

         <snippet>McAvoy is unerringly charming as Rory, a man who quickly discerns and dismisses well-meaning condescension. So one can't help wondering what he would think of this film, whose sentimentality comes across as smug.</snippet>
