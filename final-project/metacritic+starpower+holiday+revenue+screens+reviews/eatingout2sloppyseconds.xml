         <snippet>This video sequel to the gay comedy "Eating Out" (2004) is funnier, lighter, and faster paced.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ultimate rarity: a sequel that is miles ahead of its predecessor in every imaginable department.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sequel is no more than a cheapo campy goof, but this edition does contain a higher quota of laugh lines and an unsubtle message that efforts to make gay youth "go straight" is destined to fail.</snippet>

         <snippet>As before, the fun is somewhat capped by absurdly stilted acting and daytime-soap-quality DV, but the nonstop sub-Araki glibbage is plenty peppy and so is Rebekah Kochan's ding-a-ling Tiffani, a dead ringer for 90210's Tori Spelling.</snippet>

         <snippet>This sequel, with the return of the first movie's insatiably slutty Los Angeles collegians, is as vulgar as its predecessor and just as almost-smart.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eating Out 2 is sweet-natured, but like the first edition, lame and way too talky.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Rubik’s Cube of shifting sexual orientation and elaborate sex fantasies, “Sloppy Seconds” gathers all the accouterments of soft pornography -- cheesy music, low-rent acting and attractively framed genitals -- into a plot of stunning imbecility.</snippet>

         <snippet>A rollicking comedy for the gay niche that rarely rises above the level of a high school skit, Phillip J. Bartell's sequel to 2004's "Eating Out" is loaded with silliness and eye candy.</snippet>

         <snippet>A soft-core sex comedy that keeps throwing out comic variations on the idea of the line between gay and straight sexuality.</snippet>
