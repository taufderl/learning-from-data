         <snippet>One of the strengths of Sunset Story is that it introduces us to a pair of extraordinary women who have kept their dignity and independence in a world that conspires against them having either. The story of Lucille and Irja may break your heart, but it will also make your day.</snippet>

         <snippet>You probably won't find two more fascinating camera subjects, two livelier conversationalists or two richer, more rewarding, more engaging and inspiring companions in any movie, fiction or non-fiction, this year.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tender, sensitive Sunset Story sidesteps a maudlin tone for a wide-ranging account of two fragile but opinionated retirees.</snippet>

         <snippet>Aside from the women themselves, the most remarkable thing about Gabbert's unexpectedly entertaining film is how effortlessly it dispels misconceptions about the elderly.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's the cinematic equivalent of glancing up at the sky and taking a good deep breath.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a wonderfully humorous take on a seldom-broached subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has its share of look-at-these-cute-old-commies laughs… But Gabbert mostly avoids making her subjects into hobbling punch lines, or even turning them into one-dimensional heroes.</snippet>

         <snippet>The two main characters are both so funny, human and touching that Sunset Story ultimately possesses an emotional quality missing from many similarly themed efforts.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a poignant, realistic depiction of the ­elderly, far from the typical view of them as quaint and useless.</snippet>
