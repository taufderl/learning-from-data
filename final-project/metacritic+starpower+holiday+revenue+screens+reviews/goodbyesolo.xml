         <snippet>Grace is also what defines Mr. Bahrani's filmmaking. I can't think of anything else to call the quality of exquisite attention, wry humor and wide-awake intelligence that informs every frame of this almost perfect film.</snippet>

         <snippet>A film of great intelligence and quiet assurance, Goodbye Solo exhilarates without ever trafficking in easy uplift.</snippet>

         <snippet>Goodbye Solo is visually simple and stunning, especially the haunting nightscapes of Solo's perambulations. But more important, Goodbye Solo is driven by deep feeling and sensitivity. Don't miss it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The acting is flawless, the world feels utterly real, and the finale accomplishes the miracle of finding in the everyday world something profound.</snippet>

         <snippet>Utterly engrossing dual-character study, unfolding with a serene disregard for indie quirkiness, Goodbye Solo radiates authenticity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like his protagonist, Bahrani never gives up on William; his camera never stops probing. He loves West's face, and he honors its mystery.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bahrani possesses a disciplined sense of composition and form, a vision of the world that extends beyond the boundaries of his own navel, and the understanding that it is possible to make films about class and race in this country without pandering to the audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>It sounds like the old unstoppable-force-meets-immovable-object trick. Ramin Bahrani's Goodbye Solo has the trappings of such a story, but, mercifully, none of the follow-through.</snippet>

         <snippet>The acting's so true, and Bahrani's so observant, you find yourself caring about everyone onscreen.</snippet>

         <snippet>The role of William is a perfect fit for Red West, a well-weathered member of Elvis Presley's Memphis Mafia who has served as a bodyguard as well as a stuntman and bit-part actor.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a playful, elusive movie that isn't so much heartwarming as soul-cleansing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Most of the movie's subterranean emotion is found in the unsettled relationship between Solo and William, and in the extraordinary performances by the two leading men.</snippet>

         <snippet>He [Bahrani] encloses his two characters in a motel room, but he doesn't make them buddies, as a Hollywood movie would. They are characterized in great detail as separate beings.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its style is spare, rigorous, almost anti-dramatic, but it deals thoughtfully with some of the most complex elements of the human equation.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is both funny and sad, placid and provocative and, above all, hopeful and despairing.</snippet>

         <snippet>The emotion here is genuine, but the outlook is tough: in Bahrani's movies we're all aliens to each other.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately, Goodbye Solo works because the screenplay, actors, and director combine to craft honest, compelling individuals.</snippet>

         <snippet>What distinguishes Goodbye Solo, beyond Savané’s larger-than-life personality bumping up against West’s intractable curmudgeon, is the continued particularity of Bahrani’s work.</snippet>
