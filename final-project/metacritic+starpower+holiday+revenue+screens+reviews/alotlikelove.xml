         <snippet>An entertainment success, a triple threat of fresh writing, inspired directing, and, yes, good acting.</snippet>

         <snippet>In essence, British director Nigel Cole has brought a breezy arthouse sensibility to this tale of fated love.</snippet>

         <snippet>Here's a pleasant little romantic comedy that doesn't try too hard and has the virtue of doing a few things differently.</snippet>

         <snippet>Survives its surface annoyances because Lynch's script also has ambition, heart and something to say other than love conquers all.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though I liked Love's unhurried pace and oddball digressions, its obligatory romantic-comedy resolution seemed too schematic for what had preceded it.</snippet>

         <snippet>While it's certainly too derivative to be a great movie, it's too goodhearted and modest in its aspirations to be denied.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the script isn't as well-structured as it could be, the dialogue is refreshingly natural. Kutcher is surprisingly well cast as the awkward, somewhat dorky Oliver, and Peet is charming and charismatic without being cloying or artificial.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Kutcher and Peet are a low-wattage pair, with little of the verbal riffing that counts as seduction in most romantic comedies, but they have real chemistry together, and A Lot Like Love happily indulges their silly, juvenile one-upmanship.</snippet>

         <snippet>Peet is triumphant as the beguiling object of desire with wounded-bird eyes and devilish smile -- sexy and tart, then, in the space of a breath, totally, tenderly tragic. Like Oliver, we'd happily follow her anywhere.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>This is a hand-me-(dumbed)-down chick flick that is counting on Kutcher's tabloid popularity and Peet's unmistakable though here underutilized talents to cover up for rote characterizations, tired plot devices and a general lack of inspiration.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too often, the script collapses into what feels like improvisation, in which the characters find a kind of common ground: Infantilism.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Lot Like Love is a lot like a romantic comedy, except that all that's keeping these two kids apart is the trivially insufferable movie they're in.</snippet>

         <snippet>As the film stopped counting back in years and switched to months, I panicked that it would slog on to weeks, hours and seconds before reaching its inevitable end. I was wrong. About A Lot Like Love leaving you wanting a lot less, I am right.</snippet>
