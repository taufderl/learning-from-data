         <snippet>Go for Zucker is far from a perfect film but it brings easy laughter and joy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching the antic inventions of  Go for Zucker, I was moved by the thought that Jews have achieved a kind of Germanness again, and even more moved by the thought that Germans have achieved a kind of Jewishness again.</snippet>

         <snippet>Picture lets loose an experienced cast of vets on a well-honed script that has broad appeal.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zucker!'s a bona fide hit in Germany, where, apparently, there's been a shortage of Jewish comedies since, oh, 1939, give or take. But it deserves its imported rep; rare's the movie that has an Orthodox Jew tripping on Ecstasy while getting a massage from a Palestinian prostitute hours before his mamala's funeral.</snippet>

         <snippet>Writer-director Levy occasionally relies on cheap gags, but his light tone and breezy visual style are a nice contrast to Go for Zucker's metaphorical subtext about familial - and German - reunification.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zippy, well-played, Wilder-esque farce.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not quite masterful enough to achieve all its goals, but Zucker is undeniably ambitious despite its relatively lowbrow and farcical approach.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's the rare German movie calling itself a comedy that is actually funny, even if only in bits and pieces.</snippet>

         <snippet>Funny, director and co-writer Dani Levy suggests with no little coldness, how the scent of money can do what religion, ideology, and ethical principles cannot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Go for Zucker was a smash back home, where it was hailed as the first German comedy about Jews since World War II. But it will take more than that to make American audiences laugh.</snippet>

         <snippet>A tiresomely madcap story with extremely faint political (and politically incorrect) overtones.</snippet>

         <snippet>It remains a diverting, mildly entertaining movie, far short of provoking the controversy (or hysterical laughter) it apparently prompted during its release in Germany.</snippet>
