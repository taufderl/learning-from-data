         <snippet>The best is "Equilibrium" by Soderbergh, about a man being analyzed by a distracted shrink.</snippet>

         <snippet>The young guns on board are Wong Kar Wai and Steven Soderbergh, and it's sad to report that they massively outshine the nonagenarian Antonioni.</snippet>

         <snippet>The only real reason to catch Eros is to see Wong Kar-Wai's beautiful opening piece, "The Hand."</snippet>

         <snippet>Lovely though it is to look at, it does not reveal very much. Sampling the works of three prominent directors in one sitting may be what gives anthology films like this one their appeal, but the experience is often more frustrating than fulfilling.</snippet>

         <snippet>What might have been a cinephile's wet dream turns out instead to be seductive, stimulating and sodden, in that order, in the three-chapter reflection on love and desire.</snippet>

         <snippet>The omnibus film usually saves its home run for the climax, but Eros begins with the best third, Wong Kar-wai's "The Hand."</snippet>

         <snippet>For the invited filmmaker, the opportunity to make a statement is surely a thrill, but for the viewer - who can't pause indefinitely, as with a book, between stories - the focus-shifting is a demand.</snippet>

         <snippet>When the producers of Eros, a triptych of short stories about eroticism and desire, described what they wanted from Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai, American Steven Soderbergh and Italian master Michelangelo Antonioni, they must have written the memo in Chinese. Only Wong attempted something sensual.</snippet>

         <snippet>The three films are watchable but resolutely minor works, though each has something to recommend it.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a triptych of erotic-themed short films directed by contemporary giants Wong Kar-wai and Steven Soderbergh, and nonagenarian master Michelangelo Antonioni. But the auteurist feast turns out to be a paltry spread, with one director on autopilot, another playing it safe, and the last apparently working on assignment for the European "Red Shoe Diaries."</snippet>

         <snippet>Like most anthology films, this thematically linked trio of shorts is a mixed bag.</snippet>

         <snippet>Both Wong and Soderbergh have understandably expressed their gratitude at, even in this tripartite way, being part of an Antonioni project... But Eros is better for what they contribute than for his work.</snippet>

         <snippet>Interesting misfires from Wong Kar-wai and Steven Soderbergh barely manage to atone for the seedy muddle concocted by eightysomething Michelangelo Antonioni, who mocks his own reputation for existential ellipsis with his voyeuristic vignette.</snippet>

         <snippet>In reality, Eros is a letdown, a collection of bagatelles that, with one exception, fails to live up to its promise.</snippet>
