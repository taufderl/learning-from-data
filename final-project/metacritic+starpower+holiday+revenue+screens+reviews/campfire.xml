         <snippet>Campfire looks a bit drab, perhaps to show the dullness of Zionist life in the 1980s. But this doesn't take away from the poignancy of the film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Coming at a time when the settlements on the Gaza Strip are being dismantled, Cedar's film offers a sly critique of their origins, and refreshingly different point of view.</snippet>

         <snippet>A good movie that could have been better, Joseph Cedar's sensitive Israeli drama falters when he trades sociological observations for political ones.</snippet>

         <snippet>Juggles several storylines that include the personal and political, but is unable to get beyond soap-opera shtick.</snippet>

         <snippet>The timelier elements of Campfire, which cleared house at Israel's Academy Awards this year, are too salient to dismiss.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Campfire is solidly acted, it is visually drab and has a haphazard narrative momentum.</snippet>

         <snippet>The darker aspects of tribalism come under scrutiny here as nonconformists (unmarried men, women alone) are shown being marginalized.</snippet>

         <snippet>Typical of too many films produced in Israel: plodding, verbose, badly-made and completely monotonous.</snippet>
