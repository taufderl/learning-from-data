         <snippet>Now why did I like this movie? It was just plain dumb fun, is why. It is absurd and preposterous, and proud of it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dragon Emperor succeeds largely through sheer excess: It's doubtful that any idea was thrown out for being too implausible.</snippet>

         <snippet>Anyone in the market for an overblown and totally mindless adventure-comedy will certainly get his money's worth.</snippet>

         <snippet>This Mummy movie is really two movies: a good adventure epic, with all the Chinese people, and a wan one, with O'Connells and the other the Westerners.</snippet>

         <snippet>After an hour of inert exposition, a race through Shanghai gooses the movie alive. Then it plunges back into torpor.</snippet>

         <snippet>When I go to a Mummy movie, I don't want ninjas and yetis and men turned to stone. I want embalmed corpses and hieroglyphics. I want pharaoh. I want pyramids and sphinxes and Ace bandages. Did "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" take place on the Nile?</snippet>

         <snippet>It's like an Indiana Jones movie without rhythm, wit or personality, just a desperate, headlong pace.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is one bit of good news. For all you abominable snowman fans out there, "The Mummy" is filled with yetis. And, boy, are they ever angry.</snippet>

         <snippet>Competent, but so utterly bereft of any memorable moments that it becomes a bit of a bore. Perhaps it's time for a reboot – guy wrapped in bandages, shuffling around a pyramid, scaring people. You never know, it might just work.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite exotic locations, epic cinematography, and much spectacular crash and bang, this "Mummy" feels like a threadbare toss-off.</snippet>

         <snippet>Feels perfunctory and obligatory and, despite the return of several familiar characters, is more like an afterthought than an organic third piece of a trilogy puzzle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too much of the proceedings are silly rather than horrifying, with the nadir being the appearance of some particularly athletic Yetis who briefly pitch in to lend a hand.</snippet>

         <snippet>The kindest thing to be said for this frantic, cluttered mess of cheesy computer-generated action-adventure clichés is that at least you can see how the estimated $175 million budget was spent.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a movie about the undead, this lacks any supernatural chills, and by the time its obligatory final showdown arrives, it seems as hollow as the terra cotta soldiers brought to life by CGI.</snippet>

         <snippet>Remarkably, the plot has much in common with "Hellboy II: The Golden Army," yet that bundle of fun has enough vision to make even its Barry Manilow interlude seem appropriate.</snippet>

         <snippet>As for Fraser, his clumsy humanity is endearing, but by now, assuming he has invested wisely, he should have enough money saved so as to not have to waste his talent anymore.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tomb is the kind of movie you sit through dreading the expository scenes, because the acting is so bad and the dialogue so pointedly written to make sure the little ones in the audience can keep up with the plot.</snippet>
