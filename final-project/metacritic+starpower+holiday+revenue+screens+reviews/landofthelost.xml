         <snippet>I'm pleased to report the new Land of the Lost movie keenly understands that what was once scary is now ridiculous.</snippet>

         <snippet>Land of the Lost is an enjoyable regression to Saturday mornings gone by, as junky and sweet as a strawberry Pop-Tart.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is eight times as strange and exponentially more potty-mouthed than the original series.</snippet>

         <snippet>If director Brad Silberling had taken this cast to their natural extremes, he might have delivered a raucously funny sci-fi comedy -- think "Anchorman" meets "Jurassic Park." Instead, Land of the Lost is an utter misfire -- not bad enough to hate, not good enough to remember.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's cheap-looking (dinosaurs and other beasts here look like CGI loaners from Spielberg), deeply mediocre and predictable.</snippet>

         <snippet>It ends up sagging into a pleasantly undistinguished pudding. The big news is that Matt Lauer, playing himself, can act. A little. Hardly at all, really. But heâ€™s a jolly good sport, and quite handy with a fire extinguisher.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's hard to know just who the intended audience is: The movie is too surreal and bawdy for young kids and too silly for anyone older than 25.</snippet>

         <snippet>The only marginally interesting, if unsurprising, thing about the pricey movie spinoff of the junky children's television show Land of the Lost is that a lot of money has been spent on yet another cultural throwaway.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ferrell's latest excursion into delusions of manhood is director Brad Silberling's Land of the Lost, an action comedy with the sloppy construction and saving grace notes of the star's other movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Will Ferrell and Danny McBride can find the dumb fun in anything. Too bad that Land of the Lost is so much less than anything.</snippet>

         <snippet>Genially terrible, Lost is lazy, sloppy multiplex filler, good for a few solid giggles and not much more.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ferrell may well shoulder the blame for Land of the Lost, even if he doesn't deserve it. He did, however, willingly participate in this coarse, sloppy big-screen version of the old Saturday-morning time-warp adventure.</snippet>

         <snippet>It doesn't help that neither Ferrell nor McBride bring their best material, with McBride offering yet another variation on an angry redneck, and Ferrell falling back on Ron Burgundy-like bluster and nonsense exclamations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lame sketch comedy, an uninspired performance from Will Ferrell and an overall failure of the imagination turn Brad Silberling's Land of the Lost into a lethargic meander through a wilderness of misfiring gags.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The result is a movie with an exceedingly narrow target audience that should test Will Ferrell's appeal among boys maybe ages 12-14 -- about the only demo likely able to endure this laborious mess.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is also a sense that the filmmakers weren't quite certain if they wanted to make a fun, kid-friendly adventure or a bawdy adult-skewed comedy. Walking the tightrope doesn't work.</snippet>
