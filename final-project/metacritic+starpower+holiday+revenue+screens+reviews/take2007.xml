         <snippet>Driver and Renner deliver haunting performances in this story of crime and punishment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Well, you can't fault the actors. That must mean it's the fault of the writer and director. Take is a monotonous slog through dirgeland, telling a story that seems strung out beyond all reason, with flashbacks upon flashbacks delaying interminably the underwhelming climax.</snippet>

         <snippet>A woefully earnest indie about a crime and its aftermath.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, Take is too enamored of its time-shifting gimmick and cheap suspense to ultimately have much impact.</snippet>

         <snippet>Another preachy, overacted message film that owes its out-of-time structure to "21 Grams" and "Babel," except writer-director Charles Oliver uses the idea of restorative justice.</snippet>

         <snippet>Take has the audacity to excuse its bad cinematic habits as figments of both Saul and Ana's imaginations.</snippet>
