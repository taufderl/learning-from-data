         <snippet>Smartly directed by Jim Gillespie from a script by various hands, Venom is from Dimension Films and follows its stylish, energetic and darkly amusing horror movie tradition.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although, in the end, this is basically just a moss-strewn remake of his 1997 hit, "I Know What You Did Last Summer," director Jim Gillespie appears invigorated, sending his capable young cast into a series of nicely staged suspense sequences.</snippet>

         <snippet>A competent concoction of familiar ingredients, smothered with gothic mood and served up with a generous helping of teenagers: skewered, slashed and stabbed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Acquits itself well enough. Gratuitously gory and derivative to the core, Venom manages to deliver some effective frights in between large swaths of voodoo gibberish.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gillespie showed a real knack for '80s-style retro horror with "I Know What You Did," and while a few sequences here have the familiar-but-enjoyable framing and stylization of an old EC horror comic, his material defeats him.</snippet>

         <snippet>Venom certainly can't be called a good movie, but within its genre it's perfectly palatable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The final showdown between sole survivor and killer is sufficiently well done that you wonder why the rest didn't measure up.</snippet>

         <snippet>This misbegotten horror film deserved to go direct to video. Or cable. Or oblivion.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shot as "Backwater" and test-screened as "The Reaper," this film contains a couple of bracingly mean sequences, but it cleaves so closely to the slasher-movie formula that it can't muster up any suspense at all.</snippet>

         <snippet>A clichéd and flat out boring film that doesn’t even approach the mediocrity of director Jim Gillespie’s 1997 pic in the same genre, "I Know What You Did Last Summer."</snippet>

         <snippet>If ridiculous, hackneyed, gratuitously violent slasher movies aren't your thing, don't go near Venom with a 10-foot snake pole.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sadly, the concept of dialogue is totally lost on the makers of Venom, a laughably bad example of teen-scream movies.</snippet>
