         <snippet>It'd be silly to call Crank: High Voltage over the top: The top is so far below that it isn't even visible. But at this mostly unexplored altitude--only 2007's inferior "Shoot 'Em Up" comes close.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result, an eye-popping strobe of flesh and blood, is as visually stunning as it is absurdly offensive, sure to thrill some while leaving others in a state of outrage-induced catatonia.</snippet>

         <snippet>This time, the adrenalized formula is even more unpredictable, with twists, turns, curves, and splurges taking the viewer on a rollercoaster ride unlike any other.</snippet>

         <snippet>Crank 2: High Voltage is the freak show act at a carnival. It's so over-the-top that the phrase ceases to have meaning in this context. It's a bizarre concoction of testosterone, adrenaline, and psychedelics. It seeks not only to top its predecessor, "Crank," but to outdo itself at every turn.</snippet>

         <snippet>Proof that you can make good movies based on video games, as long as you don't bother making a video game first. Juice us up for Crank 3D.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie thrives on absurdity and outrage, calculating that at some point you'll give in to its gonzo energies and go along for the ride.</snippet>

         <snippet>Follows the same formula as the first, with one difference: They've managed to ramp up the action and vulgarity beyond the insane heights of the original.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you have a propensity for motion sickness you would be best served staying away. This movie is Tarantino on speed, and without focus and style. It is in-your-face and proud of it with no apologies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Laughably and knowingly preposterous, cheerfully un-PC, and violent in a way that makes the myriad slaphappy deaths of Wile E. Coyote seem downright dull in comparison.</snippet>

         <snippet>Imagine some very smart people setting out to make a very naughty action film and shooting themselves in the foot. Voila: Crank: High Voltage.</snippet>

         <snippet>In Crank: High Voltage, Statham just looks miserable, as if appearing in this lousy picture just sucked all the heart right out of him.</snippet>

         <snippet>Benefits of the first film's ancillary gross-out will jolt "Voltage" like a speedball shot to the groin, until word of mouth spreads like an STD.</snippet>

         <snippet>The diminishing returns of shock value are the movie's built-in joke, and it would be a lot funnier without the directors' unforgivably bratty postsexist/postracist/posthuman showboating.</snippet>
