         <snippet>A wry movie that, packed with his well-known friends and scored intermittently to bouncy accordion music, plays like a softer episode of "Curb."</snippet>

         <snippet>Garlin's movie is beautiful in its own way. It also suggests that David's show would still be brilliant without the aggravation. I'm not saying that David should renounce misanthropy. But maybe he could curb less of Garlin's apparent enthusiasm for people.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you’re a Chicagoan, if you have just a smidgen of interest in the city’s arts scene and if you’ve been around a while, there’s no way to be objective about I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is a minor movie, but a big-time minor movie...If there is such a thing as a must-see three-star movie, here it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>May be one of the wisest studies of urban loneliness since Paddy Chayefsky's "Marty."</snippet>

         <snippet>Laid back and affectionate, “Cheese” is the movie version of a dear friend you could spend all day with.</snippet>

         <snippet>Feels more like a series of skits than a movie, though it does tie up several plot threads in a lyrical last scene worthy of vintage Woody Allen.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unassuming and sweet-natured, and Garlin earns a lot of goodwill with his off-the-cuff wisecracks.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is visually bland and hits a few comic dead ends, but there's an element of pathos that allows us to believe in the plight of the fictional James.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cheese is written with plenty of sophisticated wit, but it is not quite convincing as a movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>None of it really adds up to much but it's smart, low-key fun -- terrible title and dangling preposition notwithstanding.</snippet>

         <snippet>Garlin, like Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine in "Marty," is good company, even when his out-of-control eating and self-loathing threaten to overwhelm him.</snippet>

         <snippet>The entire film carries a whiff of "vanity project," with several of Garlin's comedic buddies reporting for duty.</snippet>

         <snippet>James and Beth have fun in a grocery store pretending to be different characters meeting in the aisles. As they learn, sometimes the moment works, sometimes it doesn't. The same can be said for this unfailingly modest film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never completely takes off, yet somewhat overestimates the surrounding zaniness. Still, any opportunity to witness the improvisatory skills of Sarah Silverman, Bonnie Hunt and Amy Sedaris should not be missed.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story ultimately lands in incoherence; but the cameos and local details, and even some of the gags, keep it perky.</snippet>

         <snippet>Garlin's directing has little pacing, and many of the borderline gags could have been salvaged with some sharper editing. And there's a shocking amount of jokes and situations that just don't work.</snippet>
