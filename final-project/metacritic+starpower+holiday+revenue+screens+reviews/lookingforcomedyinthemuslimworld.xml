         <snippet>Like "The Aristocrats," Looking succeeds smashingly both as a comedy and as a savvy deconstruction of comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>I liked the movie. I smiled a lot. It maintained its tone in the face of bountiful temptations to get easy laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>It would have better if Brooks had invested more time trying to discover what makes AMERICANS laugh.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fans of Brooks and his wry, dry neuroticism will not be disappointed as he whines and whimpers around New Delhi.</snippet>

         <snippet>Albert Brooks may have come up with the funniest movie premise of the year in Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a sly, low-key comedy in which he casts himself as a neurotic, self-absorbed curmudgeon.</snippet>

         <snippet>A funny and appropriately skewed comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brooks' film is especially welcome now because it frankly admits that most Americans are ignorant about Muslims and have a lot to learn, in contrast with the few other Hollywood movies dealing with Muslims -- "Syriana," "Munich" -- which seem to suggest that non-Muslim viewers can emerge knowing the score.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie doesn't so much end as reach a stopping point and limp hurriedly off-screen, like a bad stand-up chased out by boo birds.
But God, is it funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it risks political incorrectness every step of the way, film is more a pleasant laugher than a sharp-edged satire.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's only half of a good comedy. After a delicious opening and setup, the movie really doesn't go anywhere very interesting, and doesn't come close to any epiphanies about the subject at hand, even in subtext.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brooks is always a dry vintage, so the lack of outright laughs is to be expected. But Looking for Comedy is more depressing than funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>This Brooks is a comedian who forgets the golden rule of "know your audience." He thinks he'll get his laughs if he keeps doing the same act with better lighting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not Brooks' funniest film, but it possesses his trademark wry humor and is slyly observant.</snippet>

         <snippet>Front-loaded with inspired gags, and the first half-hour is both sneakily and explosively funny, raising expectations that are never quite met.</snippet>

         <snippet>A reasonably amusing effort that manages to poke fun at Brooks' neuroses and governmental blundering with equal skill.</snippet>

         <snippet>Doesn't conclude so much as just stop, because Brooks, having come up with a great hook for a movie, didn't bother to come up with a satisfying story to go along with it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie has a perversely unifying effect: Muslims, Christians and Jews may not be able to agree on exactly who the heck Jesus is, but they're fully capable of bonding in boredom.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brooks is looking for comedy in all the wrong places. He's no longer his own White Whale. He's something slower, in a shell--his own turtle.</snippet>

find Brooks' performance excruciating.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie isn't racist; it's just lame. If Brooks truly cared about Muslims or how their funny bones worked, Looking for Comedy might have had some zing, but all his character is interested in is the 500-page report he has to deliver - a homework assignment from hell.</snippet>

         <snippet>The question for skittish distributors is not whether Looking for Comedy will play in Peshawar, but how long the movie will take to put Peoria to sleep.</snippet>

         <snippet>A particularly painful event for those of us weaned on Brooks' earliest films, Saturday Night Live shorts and vintage clips of his deadpan standup appearances. It contains precisely two funny moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, Brooks errs badly by having his film centered in India. Yes, India - which, as most people know, is not a predominantly Muslim country. Rather than look for comedy in the Muslim world, Brooks uses this film to make fun of contemporary Indian society.</snippet>
