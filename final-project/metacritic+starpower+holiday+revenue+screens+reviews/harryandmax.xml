         <snippet>One of the film's oddest missteps is in making the boy-band gig just another occupation, instead of using it as a central way to illuminate the brothers' unusual bond.</snippet>

         <snippet>To consider Harry and Max as being about incestuous feelings would be shortchanging it, because the film is really about the evolving nature of love and the need to define it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Munch's usual stylishness and casual storytelling tenor lend persuasion to this curious drama about two brothers, both teen music idols, who demonstrate an incestuous attraction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Intermittently insightful, but a disappointment from the talented Munch.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all its maturity - and nice performances from Johnson and Phoenix - the film winds up dancing around the 500-lb gorilla in the middle of the room rather than facing the pathology of its real subject head-on.</snippet>

         <snippet>Provocative without being especially thoughtful or credible, Harry and Max registers as a severe disappointment coming from this talented filmmaker.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's one of those rare movie failures that truly warrants being called ambitious.</snippet>

         <snippet>Christopher Munch wrote and directed this feature and it is nearly impossible not to feel deep-seated anger towards him for what he has wrought on screen.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are brave, boundary-breaching movies, and there are mad, foolhardy ones. Harry and Max belongs to the latter breed.</snippet>

         <snippet>The most shocking thing about Harry and Max isn't the subject matter. The most shocking thing is just how tepid it is.</snippet>
