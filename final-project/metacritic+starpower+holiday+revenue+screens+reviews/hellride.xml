         <snippet>The motorcycle film genre is one that has all but been forgotten, but if any film could start the resurrection of this cinema genre's corpse, it's Larry Bishop's Hell Ride.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you enjoy foulmouth dialogue mixed with sex, violence, bikes, badass bikers, boobs, babes, booze, brawling, broken noses and broken promises - then the Quentin Tarantino-produced Hell Ride should make you one happy guy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film has energy but isn't well paced. Nothing about it quite gels.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a self-amused, self-conscious, seriously limp throwback to motorcycle westerns of the 1970s.</snippet>

         <snippet>I managed to get through the biker extravaganza Hell Ride, a narcissistic piece of soft-core porn and macho camp, by mashing it together in my mind with the equally woeful, family-friendly biker comedy "Wild Hogs." After all, both are full of hellions gone to seed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Larry Bishop's painfully self-conscious homage to biker films of yesteryear is a carefully crafted pastiche that doesn't miss a wild-deadly-angels-devils-sadists-revenge clich√© and can't hold a candle to the down-and-dirty likes of "The Glory Stompers."</snippet>

         <snippet>The film gets the scummy patina right, all phony-Leone dusty trails, but while everybody on screen looks to be enjoying themselves, it is no fun to watch.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino. Shame on him. He intends it no doubt as another homage to grindhouse pictures, but I've seen a lot of them, and they were nowhere near this bad. "Hell's Angels on Wheels," for example: pretty good.</snippet>

         <snippet>The narrative is murky and ludicrous, the action violent and nihilistic, the contemporary western ethos painfully pretentious.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story is a shambles, incoherent throughout, veined with tirelessly wearying flashbacks, hallucinations, and just plain old lousy storytelling.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bishop's jumbled, wholly unexciting throwback has very little on its mind beyond mythologizing its maker as a bad-ass biker named Pistolero.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's depressingly self-conscious and turgid, and a cast that includes Dennis Hopper, David Carradine, Michael Madsen and Eric Balfour can't drag Hell Ride out of the mire.</snippet>

         <snippet>After all the bloated lines are delivered, and dozens of women are debased, and Bishop has attitudinized the story line into incomprehensibility, audience members will be asking themselves how they got on this Hell Ride and what they did to deserve it.</snippet>
