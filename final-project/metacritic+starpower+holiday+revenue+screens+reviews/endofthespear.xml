         <snippet>Inspiring enough to make you wish that the filmmakers had reined in their sentimental excesses.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is exceedingly earnest stuff, dolloped with Christian goodness and solid production values.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Hanon's film stints on character development, he convincingly portrays the events that foster redemption and forgiveness, as over time the Waodani shed their culture of violence.</snippet>

         <snippet>In spite of End Of The Spear's fundamental conservatism, the missionaries' disastrous initial encounter with the Waodani ultimately teaches the progressive message that when it comes to winning the hearts and minds of foreign cultures, Bibles and superior technology are no substitute for a thorough understanding of their language and culture.</snippet>

         <snippet>Spear has all the earmarks of a middling Indiewood product, from its competent second-tier cast (including "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" hunklet Chad Allen in a dual role as a slain missionary and his grown son) to its earnest plotting and leaden pacing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although overly earnest and often stilted, the film should find great favor principally among religious auds.</snippet>

         <snippet>What creeps in is the dramatic simple-mindedness attendant with a purity-of-purpose mind-set.</snippet>

         <snippet>It might have been inspired by actual events, but End of the Spear is, literally and figuratively, simply too dull to make any impact.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shot in Panama, with a cast of local Indians and B-tier Latino and Anglo actors, End of the Spear has neither the marquee heft nor the artistic gravitas of "The New World."</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not remotely as luscious or half as bold as Malick's movie, but it is shorter and more educational.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is tentative, dramatically speaking...The most powerful moments come at the end -- documentary excerpts of Steve Saint, the son of one of the missionaries, and his friendship with Mincayani, the man who killed his father.</snippet>

         <snippet>The naivet√© with which the missionaries approach their initial meeting with the Waodani, whose propensity to violence was well-documented, appears at once incredibly stupid and divinely loving.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sincere but underwhelming dramatization of one of the biggest news stories of 1956.</snippet>

         <snippet>In documentary footage played over the closing credits, the real warrior is introduced to American fast food and returns to his people too fat and sluggish to spear himself a snack, let alone a missionary.</snippet>

         <snippet>This ersatz jungle adventure is really a thinly disguised Sunday School lesson in faith, charity and the savagery of life without Christ.</snippet>
