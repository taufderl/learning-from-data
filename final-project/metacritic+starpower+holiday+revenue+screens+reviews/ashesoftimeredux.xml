         <snippet>Dreamlike, disjointed, and possessed of a stunningly complex sensual and narrative poetry that may confound audiences not familiar with Chinese director Wong's defining stylistic tropes, Ashes of Time Redux is, simply, one of the most gorgeous films ever made.</snippet>

         <snippet>"Ashes" is glorious and ultimately wrenching, but it's a tough journey.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wittily, earnestly, gorgeously sets up the paradox he has returned to throughout his career--that of romantic memory as both scourge and succor.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a little visually precious and obscure but still a marvelously wistful film of regret and retreat, in which even the magic wine of forgetfulness erases only the memories, not the pain.</snippet>

         <snippet>"Ashes of Time" was always more a work of philosophy than pure entertainment, and a decade and a half later it still is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Windblown, with a sage and playful Zen vibe, Wong Kar Wai's Ashes of Time Redux is a color-saturated, slo-mo martial arts piece about time, memory, love, regret, betrayal.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ashes of Time Redux is primarily a sensory experience that deserves to be seen on as big a screen as possible.</snippet>

         <snippet>Strange and beautiful and transfixing and confusing, it's quite the sight - martial-arts fans may find themselves disappointed, but Wong Kar-wai addicts will be delighted.</snippet>

         <snippet>One man's befuddlement is another's awe at the ineffability of time, and from either perspective, this is a spectacle not soon forgotten, even if never understood.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film has all the visual flourishes we expect of Doyle and Wong, and they're reason enough to see Ashes of Time Redux. Just don't expect to make sense of the plot.</snippet>

         <snippet>As in the original version, the fights are outweighed by existential angst and Buddhist introspection, but the sequence in which a blind swordsman (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) takes on an army of thieves is still gangbusters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Only in its final scenes do the usual WKW themes emerge in full bloom, but purists shouldn't miss it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Martial-arts lovers may find it too arty, and art-film lovers, Wong's international fan base, may find it too generic and too violent.</snippet>

         <snippet>The temptation of artists to fiddle with their earlier works brings predictably mixed results in Ashes of Time: Redux.</snippet>

         <snippet>I enjoyed Ashes of Time Redux, up to a point. It's great-looking, and the characters all know what they would, although we do not.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ashes of Time Redux remains a hermetic and rather frustrating work, dotted by lonely, windblown figures dwarfed by the sand dunes of western China.</snippet>
