         <snippet>Rock the Bells doesn't just delve behind the scenes; it makes a showstopping guest-MC out of each crazy new obstacle.</snippet>

         <snippet>At several points, Chang is the only thing standing between his event and total chaos, as frustrated ticket-holders rush the gates.</snippet>

         <snippet>For connoisseurs of stories of show business near-disasters, "Bells" is compelling viewing.</snippet>

         <snippet>In a film that quickly reveals itself to be a love letter to Wu, some of the best moments have nothing to do with that legendary hip-hop collective: Sage Francis taunting the unruly, increasingly tense crowd with his cerebral, political performance-art hip-hop; Redman playfully admonishing his young son to be good and then giving the boy a kiss when the paternal command wounds.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stressful to watch, but its entertaining stage performances and document of people under pressure should interest even non-rap fans.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a show we don't see, presumably because of issues with music rights, and while "much ado about nothing" might be overstating things, after more than an hour and a half of buildup, it would have been nice to see Wu-Tang perform.</snippet>

         <snippet>This isn't about the verities of hip-hop so much as the chaos and confusion of mounting a big production with a slew of stoned MCs.</snippet>
