         <snippet>It's a stylish scramble of evocative footage, groovy music, and crazy-candid reminiscences from key players still proud to score.</snippet>

         <snippet>Funky, scrappy, dishy, screwy story of that star-studded, gilded squad.</snippet>

         <snippet>Crowder and Dower's film is a refreshing reminder that without Ross and the Erteguns, pundits would have had to coin an entirely different term to describe "soccer moms," since without the Cosmos' brief and shining moment in the sun, suburban soccer leagues would be as rare as collegiate boccie tournaments.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once in a Lifetime, which is being released at the peak of World Cup fever, is the sort of sports documentary that will appeal even to nonfans. It's a quintessential only-in-New York story.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once in a Lifetime performs a belated autopsy on the Cosmos and the North American Soccer League and basically concludes that they died of impatience.</snippet>

         <snippet>This tale of the team that for a brief period in the 1970s promised to popularize soccer in the U.S. has it all: heroes, villains, sex and, oh yes, some sports as well.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once In A Lifetime is less a proper documentary than an extended VH1 Behind The Music episode, but there's only a little bit wrong with that.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once in a Lifetime's only major failing is the fact that the iconic Pelé is seen only in period footage.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is only so-so, borrowing a little from the VH-1 school of popumentary but lacking the snazzy production values.</snippet>

         <snippet>This intermittently fascinating documentary chronicles the rise and fall of the Cosmos --which is also the rise and fall of U.S. soccer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the movie promises a Behind the Music–type look at the meteoric rise and tragic fall of the Cosmos -- a team (if the press notes are to be believed) overwhelmed by wealth, groupies, rivalry and power struggles -- it all adds up to a tempest in a tea pot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite the title, this is less a soccer documentary than a corporate hagiography along the lines of "The Last Mogul" or "The Kid Stays in the Picture"; its real hero isn't Cosmos star Pele (who wisely declined to be interviewed), but Steve Ross, CEO of Warner Communications, which owned the team.</snippet>
