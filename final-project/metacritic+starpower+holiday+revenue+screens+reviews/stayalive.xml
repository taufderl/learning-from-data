         <snippet>Horror buffs looking for a novel twist on genre formulas should look elsewhere, but this body-count potboiler about a sinister video game and the poor dopes who make the mistake of playing it is the movie equivalent of junk food: It's not good, but it's predictable and even satisfying, in a low-expectations way.</snippet>

         <snippet>A passable horror-thriller for the young crowd, assuming a movie can lure them away from PlayStations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite some hackneyed qualities, helmer William Brent Bell's good-looking if undistinguished cast and the seemingly fresh twist on an old tale should lure the usual fans of mayhem, murder and the medieval.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stay Alive spends a lot of time inside the video game system, and what will terrify the audience very early on is the realization that there's better acting in the video game than on the big screen.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a gothic backstory to all this, which makes no sense but looks pretty cool.</snippet>

         <snippet>The star of Stay Alive is a cutting-edge video game, but the film still has hackneyed horror at its heart. And worse, it's not even the stylishly, wittily executed hackneyed horror of the "Scream" movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Here's a movie that tries to be a video game but is less entertaining than a vending machine.</snippet>

         <snippet>Always the way in horror flicks: These first scenes, when the characters are being tenderly established and the concept is still young, are the best.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a fascinating and terrifying story to be told about Elizabeth Bathory, the dramatically depraved 17th century sadist known as the Blood Countess.....This ain't it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stay Alive is death porn without the porn: Director William Brent Bell's pre-gore cutaways should enrage even those horror buffs for whom suspense is irrelevant, to say nothing of the fact that the movie's only real scare tactic is playing what sounds like a reverbed electric razor on the soundtrack.</snippet>

         <snippet>I never really expected something so utterly lame-brained. Though, the film is not as awful as I've heard, it's quite possibly the laziest script I've ever seen.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stay Alive is D.O.A, a notion of an outline of a rough draft of a killer video-game flick.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stay Alive has none of the vicarious thrills of, say, "Konami: Silent Hill 2." It's barely even Pong unplugged.</snippet>
