         <snippet>With his self-deprecating demeanor and easy laugh, Glass is a congenial presence, and now and then he lets an insight drop.</snippet>

         <snippet>As fascinating as Glass often is, it's simultaneously too conventional and not conventional enough.</snippet>

         <snippet>The lack of a credible external perspective beyond the narrative provided by Glass, his friends, family, and associates, makes the film feel too cozy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Much like its subject: affable, quotable and emotionally guarded in the extreme.</snippet>

         <snippet>Another superficial film about music from Scott Hicks ("Shine"), picture runs a distant second to the superior new film on John Adams and Peter Sellars, "Wonders Are Many," which really captures how a composer works.</snippet>

         <snippet>Glass is a stupefyingly dull portrait of a man who doesn't seem to be lying when he says, "I have so few secrets."</snippet>
