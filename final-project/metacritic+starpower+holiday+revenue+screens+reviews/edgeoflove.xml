         <snippet>The cast is strong and the first act has an intriguingly dreamy quality, but it gives way to a soggy ending.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film belongs to the women, with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!) and Miller again proving that she has everything it takes to be a major movie star.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the period drama has several redeeming features, tonally it's all over the map, veering between artsy stylization and hum-drum, sometimes almost twee melodrama.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Edge Of Love is more like a museum piece, placing historical figures in frozen positions, and asking us to judge them as the curators do.</snippet>

         <snippet>That none of the protagonists earns the audience's sympathy is more likely a failure of the real-life characters rather than the actors, who deliver fine performances -- especially Rhys, who seems to be channeling Richard Burton channeling Dylan Thomas at his most manipulatively loutish.</snippet>

         <snippet>Holds a lot of promise in its first hour and never completely falls apart, but it's ultimately not the movie it might have been.</snippet>

         <snippet>The best thing The Edge of Love could do for you is to send you back to Thomas's poetry. Dash this folderol.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sometimes glossy, sometimes hard-edged, the film alternates between glitz and unpleasantness and ends as a kind of glum soap opera, too glam to be bleak and too bleak to be so glam.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Edge of Love may be intended as a biopic of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, but it’s destined to be remembered as the movie that brought Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller into the same bathtub.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story here, plucked from Thomas's life and embellished, proves almost entirely devoid of interest.</snippet>

         <snippet>A "great poet" movie, the poet in this case being Dylan Thomas, and it's utter bollocks.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director John Maybury showed a defter hand with the artist biopic in his 1998 Francis Bacon film, "Love Is the Devil." Here he repeatedly falls into the genre’s traps, creating an inert, claustrophobic movie.</snippet>
