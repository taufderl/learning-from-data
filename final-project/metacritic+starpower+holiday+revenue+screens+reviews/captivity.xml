         <snippet>Roland Joffé creates a visually interesting and aurally unsettling vibe, and the story from B-movie maestro Larry Cohen keeps it simple.</snippet>

         <snippet>Quite possibly the final word on a much-maligned genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>Destined to be better remembered for its grisly billboard imagery than for its relatively tame torture-porn tropes, Captivity is a thoroughly nasty piece of work that nonetheless earns credit for generating modest suspense after a predictable but effective plot twist around the 50-minute mark.</snippet>

         <snippet>Roland Joffé brings an artful video-grunge look, and not much else, to this "Saw" clone.</snippet>

         <snippet>Torture junkies should remember it’s only four months to Saw IV -- so you can afford to avoid Captivity.</snippet>

         <snippet>A terrible rehash of better torture genre exploitation, with none of the charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie has been thoroughly eclipsed by "Captivity" the marketing.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>In a genre where killers love to play head games, it's a clever idea (Cohen's?) to have this one remain mute, but that leaves Cuthbert to carry much of the psychological load, and there's no substance to her character, apart from the suggestion that she's being punished for her vanity.</snippet>

         <snippet>A lurid thriller that marks a new career low for both director Roland Joffé (The Killing Fields, The Mission) and co-screenwriter Larry Cohen (Phone Booth, It's Alive).</snippet>

         <snippet>Captivity is torture porn without the sex. Cuthbert squirms, screams, weeps and pleads for her life with great conviction. Slick, sick sleaze.</snippet>

         <snippet>The end result doesn't even satisfy on its own sleazy terms. Not only does it lack the satirical nihilism of the "Hostel" films or the admittedly clever torture machinations of the "Saw" series, it doesn't even provide its target young male audience with the requisite nudity.</snippet>
