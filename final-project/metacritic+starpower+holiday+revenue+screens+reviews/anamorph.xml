         <snippet>The unfortunate fact is that it's more than a little dull when it isn't preposterous.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Miller and his co-writer, Tom Phelan, manage to get under your skin largely with borrowed implements, though they receive solid support from Willem Dafoe and the resourceful veteran cinematographer Fred Murphy.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are undeniably arresting moments along the way, thanks to Dafoe's subtly intense performance and the well-crafted visuals.</snippet>

         <snippet>Any resemblance between these and the real-world practice known as murder--committed for trifling old human motivations like blind anger and money--is strictly coincidental.</snippet>

         <snippet>Beyond its cool, reflective surfaces and infinite plays with perspective lies nothing -- character, relationships, motives all seemingly irrelevant. Even Willem Dafoe as a haunted cop cannot ground these artfully grisly optical illusions, unconnected to any comprehensible storyline.</snippet>

         <snippet>The long shadow of David Fincher's "Seven" falls on Anamorph, a moody, ultimately unexciting thriller.</snippet>

         <snippet>A serial-killer flick told like an art lecture, Anamorph manages to be gruesome yet dull.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director H.S. Miller thinks he's made something broodingly visionary when you're more likely to be aesthetically shaken up by one of Mad magazine's Fold-Ins.</snippet>
