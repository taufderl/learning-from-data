         <snippet>Nicely balances action and adventure with American Indian wisdom and a modest romance to provide a graphic-comic-book movie experience for males in urban markets.</snippet>

         <snippet>Urban and Bloodgood make the most of their parts, locking eyes and arms, and occasionally using American English as if the snowy 10th century were another way of saying, "Where the après ski?"</snippet>

         <snippet>It's undone by a murky palette, silly horror-movie cliches, dumb dialogue and a confusing climactic sequence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pathfinder is aimed more at the action-figure crowd than the history buffs.</snippet>

         <snippet>After the first 1,000 or so beheadings, impalements and severed limbs, Pathfinder's slash may just induce sleep.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pathfinder's moody, muddy look is courtesy of music-video director Marcus Nispel, who doesn't distinguish between people and tree trunks when it comes to emotional content.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Like "300" and "Apocalypto," this latest bit of historical balder-dash stands in direct defiance of proven action-movie formulas, trusting its brutal concept and striking visuals to overcome a lack of star power.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of the funniest films of the year. That's not good news for this attempted action-adventure, which clearly lost its way in its own copious fog.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is one redeeming skirmish -- the climactic fight involving a snowy cliff and an elaborate pulley system -- but from the guy who's directed videos for Cher, Amy Grant, Billy Joel, and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony? We expected more.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The fault here lies in the film’s dead rhythm, which never lights the sparks necessary for an action film. The plot and action progress like an eroding lakeshore, but the energy and excitement are washed away in every scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a tedious experience in almost every way: The acting is numbingly one-note, the CGI work is unconvincing and often downright shoddy, and the action is poorly staged and framed so close you can never tell for sure who is lopping off whose head.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie takes us on a journey to an ugly, contentious period in our misty, ancient past - all the way back to four months ago, when "Apocalypto" came out.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too small to be a spectacle, too humorless to take seriously and too stupid to pass muster at a middle school writing workshop.</snippet>

         <snippet>The director, Marcus Nispel, takes his butchery very seriously. (He was the lead vivisectionist for the remake of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.") He may not be able to make this movie move, but, man, can he make an eyeball fly.</snippet>
