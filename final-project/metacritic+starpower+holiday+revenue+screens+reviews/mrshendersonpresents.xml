         <snippet>It offers a feel-good experience, but without the heavy dose of schmaltz that often accompanies such a production.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's funny, touching and crammed to the rafters with clever dialogue, splashy production numbers and stiff-upper-lip charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a shimmery beaded curtain of a movie, a slight, charming picture that's almost all facade. But what a facade!</snippet>

         <snippet>Just as there will always be an England, there will always be a certain kind of English film: the highly polished entertainment, well-acted, genteelly amusing and impeccably turned out.
Mrs. Henderson Presents is the latest example of the trend and an especially satisfying one.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mrs. Henderson hits all its marks, well-worn though they be, and Dench fans will once more find themselves glorying in her reckless spirit.</snippet>

         <snippet>Say what you will about feel-good films anchored by feisty old broads, the English have a knack with them and Stephen Frears' fact-based tale of a formidable, aristocratic widow who makes it her mission to put naked girls on the London stage is delightful.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a slight story to be sure, but the pleasures of Mrs. Henderson Presents lie less with the narrative and more with the film's tone and the dynamic duo of Dench and Hoskins.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has an old-fashioned feel, as if it had been made in the period of its setting. I mean this as a compliment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mrs. Henderson Presents is not great cinema, and neither was the Windmill great theater, but they both put on a good show.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike its subject, "Henderson" breaks no new ground. But like its reliable star, it's a welcome exponent of a valued tradition.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is Dame Judi's show. However extraordinary an actor she may be, she cannot conceal the obvious fact that she's having the time of her life here. Isn't that delicious?</snippet>

         <snippet>Poking fun at uptight British civility has long been a monocle-shattering comedic staple, and Mrs. Henderson Presents gets by for a while on its genial naughtiness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dench deserves better, and unfortunately it will probably be a long time before she gets another starring role in a movie custom-made for an actress her age.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>In its juxtaposition of voluptuous nudity with the horrors of war, in its evocation of idealized beauty draped like gods and goddesses of Grecian art, the film invokes classical ideas about how the life force asserts itself most aggressively in the face of death.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The subplot involving a tragic romance between a soldier and one of the living statues (the lovely Kelly Reilly) is hell on the humor and on a movie that stays content to do the trite thing.</snippet>

         <snippet>A bigscreen feature executed with a cookie-cutter small-screen sensibility, this often charming but untextured fact-based period piece is buoyed along by the redoubtable Judi Dench.</snippet>

         <snippet>Watching this reasonably funny, professionally assembled calculation is a little like snuggling up in front of the television with a mug of hot cocoa and a warm blanket. Those who prefer their drinks and recreation spiked would do well to look elsewhere.</snippet>

         <snippet>A rather schizophrenic comedy that gives respected performers Dame Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins a chance to show they don't take themselves too seriously.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stephen Frears has had more downs than ups of late, but I would never have thought the man responsible for "My Beautiful Laundrette" and "The Grifters" capable of stooping to pap as pappy as this unbearably chipper take on the real-life story of Laura Henderson.</snippet>

         <snippet>It says something that during a scene in which nude chorines are turned into a fleshy backdrop, you spend as much time looking at your watch as what's on screen.</snippet>
