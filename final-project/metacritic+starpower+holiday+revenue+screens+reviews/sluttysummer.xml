         <snippet>Tries to be a gay version of "Sex and the City," which was pretty gay to begin with.</snippet>

         <snippet>Andreas' cast and crew, however, have done an admirable job of backing up that hilarious title with an intelligent little film that knows its limitations and makes the most of a shoestring budget.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lacks the finesse to attract significant attention beyond its target audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>The drama is unintentionally humorous, the humor incredibly labored and the acting rarely better than one might find in a Chi Chi LaRue XXX production.</snippet>

         <snippet>Andreas is way too low-energy to hold the screen as the film's lead, but he was wise to surround himself with a talented cast. Unfortunately, the wooden dialogue and overall shallowness of the writing keep the film from being even an amiable diversion.</snippet>

         <snippet>First-timer Casper Andreas approaches his subject with the subtlety of a wrecking ball. Tired jokes are repeated over and over.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is a labor of love for Casper Andreas, who wrote, directed and starred in this first feature. For the actors he has chosen, it's a labor of lust, with copious necking and grappling required. For the audience, it's just a labor.</snippet>
