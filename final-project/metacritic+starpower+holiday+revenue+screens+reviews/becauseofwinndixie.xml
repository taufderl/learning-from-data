         <snippet>Most likely chosen for its shaggy-dog looks, Winn-Dixie is actually a great deal more special than you'd expect, a fitting analogy for a film no parent should be too quick to dismiss.</snippet>

         <snippet>To Winn-Dixie's great credit, both as a book and as a dandy, dignified movie, there's nothing condescendingly lesson-like in the wisdom India acquires.</snippet>

         <snippet>Matthews holds his own with his experienced co-stars, and his half- talking/half-singing explanation of his criminal past is the movie's best scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>In pace, sensibility, and big, beating heart, this is a child's first indie film, and it's the better for it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The casting of Daniels, Tyson and Saint, all of whom underplay effortlessly, was shrewd.</snippet>

         <snippet>Uneven though it is, Because of Winn-Dixie, based on Kate Di Camillo's novel, is tough to dislike.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sweet film with no big action moments may be a hard sell to young male audiences, but it's nevertheless a quality story that the whole family can watch together.</snippet>

         <snippet>Limiting the potential overripeness of the material with tact and sincerity, he (Wang) generally makes the most of his resourceful cast; only the dog overacts.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sweet and warm-hearted, but there is another film with a similar story that is boundlessly better, and that is "My Dog Skip" (2000).</snippet>

         <snippet>Jeff Daniels is a compelling-enough actor to lift almost any film out of mediocrity, but even he has his work cut out for him.</snippet>

         <snippet>A harmless, pleasant comic drama, but elements that may have seemed delightfully eccentric on the page take on unfortunate new tones when translated to film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never quite works as a film. The failure to create appropriate cinematic metaphors reduces it to "happiness is a warm puppy" superficiality.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thanks to director Wayne Wang ("The Joy Luck Club"), there are also artistic touches that keep this movie from sticking to the roof of the mouth the way peanut butter does to Opal's pet.</snippet>

         <snippet>It means well, but it's all just a bit too tired a formula - even by the standards of a kids film. Put this one in the top field to 'rest'.</snippet>

         <snippet>The problem is that director Wayne Wang seems deaf to the tonal differences between coming-of-age, magic realism and children's comedy.</snippet>
