         <snippet>What makes husband-and-wife directing team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' hilarious debut such a great family film isn't that it's suitable for the whole family (it's not), but that it speaks a simple truth about what it means to be part of one.</snippet>

         <snippet>You won't see a brighter, truer affirmation of the All-American messed-up improvisational family than Little Miss Sunshine.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the film itself isn't perfect, who cares about perfection in the face of abundant life, authentic screwiness and lovely surprises by the busload?</snippet>

         <snippet>This indie, a sweet, tart and smart satire about a family of losers in a world obsessed with winning, is an authentic crowd pleaser. There's been no more satisfying American comedy this year.</snippet>

         <snippet>It looks at the all-American obsession with winning and chortles darkly. You still come out of the movie wanting to give your family a hug.</snippet>

         <snippet>The irony is, this family isn't mismatched: All six bickering characters are connected by empathy as well as blood, and we wait for them to figure that out.</snippet>

         <snippet>A prime example of a dysfunctional-family comedy that also doubles as a road movie. Even the vehicle of transport is dysfunctional.</snippet>

         <snippet>Little Miss Sunshine is an enchanting anthem to loserdom -- a dark comedy that piles on setback after setback and yet never loses its helium.</snippet>

         <snippet>Family. Can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em. Little Miss Sunshine, a stormy quasi-comedy destined to polarize audiences, is a perfect specimen of this unsentimental attitude.</snippet>
