         <snippet>Uproarious romp, grounded in believable if gleefully implausible human behavior, is a model of comic timing.</snippet>

         <snippet>You can expect to fall about, snort and hoot, at times hard enough to hurt inner body parts that only doctors can identify.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a Farrelly film for adults, if not the entire family, and its a charmer, honest both to the nature of the loves we choose in haste, and the fear that makes us so hasty so often.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the sitcom humor of this is much broader and funnier than in May's film, it is also the part most faithful in spirit to the original.</snippet>

         <snippet>Farrelly brothers films are looking better and better, but aren't nearly as funny as their grungy early films that hit with the stealth and vigor of guerrilla commandos. Maybe there is a kind of heartbreak here after all.</snippet>

         <snippet>Grodin always seems like a real guy, whereas Stiller, even working it, is just the designated loser-clown of the megaplex era. He's too harmless to break any hearts.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie earns its R-rating with some graphic (and hilarious) sex scenes and a torrent of four-letter words, but this is a much more sophisticated enterprise than a mere gross-out comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>This remake is distinctly a Farrelly brothers' flick -- sentimental, rambling and raunchy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Heartbreak Kid is funniest when it leaves the body-humor behind for something truly subversive: a sequence of Eddie’s repeated attempts to cross the Mexico/U.S. border with a bunch of illegals and get back home is wicked, ticklish and inspired--all of the things the Farrellys should get home to themselves.</snippet>

         <snippet>It also has been retooled to be a Farrelly brothers comedy, which means most of Simon's wit has been replaced with gags involving S&amp;M cruelty, explicit bestiality, flatulence, nose mucous, people urinating on each other, and foul-mouthed old men (Stiller's father, Jerry).</snippet>

         <snippet>The Farrellys have always danced along the tightrope between funny-disgusting and just plain gross in "There's Something About Mary" and "Shallow Hal." If the ratio was about 50-50 at the best of times, it's now 30-70 in favor of crassness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Embellishments to Neil Simon's original script were inevitable, but when you're adding an "Uncle Tito," you're definitely on the wrong track.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ethnic humor that gave May's movie its charge is replaced by crass mean-spiritedness. If I were in movie hell, I'd rather see "Good Luck Chuck" again than return to this atrocity.</snippet>

         <snippet>The results are not endearing. Eddie comes off not as a beleaguered Everyman but a heedless, dishonest knob trying to undo a deal that gave him exactly what he deserved. 
The real surprise is Carlos Mencia, playing an exuberant clerk at the resort hotel. But when Carlos Mencia is the funniest thing in your movie, you've got serious problems.</snippet>
