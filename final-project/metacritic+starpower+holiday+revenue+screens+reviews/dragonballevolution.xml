         <snippet>May or may not appeal to fans of the Japanese fantasy franchise it is based on, but aficionados of apocalyptic teenybopper kung fu extravaganzas are in for a real treat.</snippet>

         <snippet>Far more entertaining than it deserves to be, unless you're a 10-year-old boy, in which case it's only the greatest movie ever made.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nearly all the actors seem to be having a good time, and the action moves so fast that you don't mind when something nuts happens.</snippet>

         <snippet>A popular Japanese manga series gets a pleasing if paint-by-numbers live-action makeover in Dragonball Evolution, which half-heartedly tries to keep the faith for its pubescent male fanbase.</snippet>

         <snippet>Marvel at the fact that something this trippy made it to our local multiplex.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is crammed with treats for old-school "Dragonball" fans, from the inclusion of all these characters (who don't actually do much) to the moment when spiky-haired Goku dons his orange gi. For everyone else, this amounts to another seen-it-before, probably-willing-to-see-it-again distraction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director James Wong ("Final Destination") and writer Ben Ramsey are utterly blas√© in their approach to the series' mythology and structure, cobbling together an 84-minute movie that seems to exist only to rile up fanboys. On that count -- and that count alone -- Dragonball Evolution triumphs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bottom line: costumed Goku and Chi Chi cosplayers may argue the finer points of this adaptation, but it is fairly dazzling it its own overextended, futurist-teenpulp fashion, and Chow makes a vastly more entertaining Roshi than he did a King.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just know there's a whole lot more great stuff out there than just what Evolution has in store for you -- namely, the anime that it was based on.</snippet>

         <snippet>Completely lacking in visual, narrative or stylistic coherence, the film also suffers from cheap-looking visual effects and poorly staged and edited action sequences that will not exactly please the fanboys.</snippet>
