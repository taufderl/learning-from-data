         <snippet>Bronson owes a little or a lot to Kubrick's "Clockwork Orange," but if that's a crime I wish more people would commit it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bronson invites you to admire its protagonist as a pure, muscular embodiment of anarchy. And perhaps you will, but you may also be glad that he’s still behind bars.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whether it's Peterson/Bronson's more theatrical bits or his untamable character's many blood-spitting, knuckle-beating, explosions, Hardy chomps down on his once-in-a-career role with stunning ferocity and never lets go. He's extraordinary.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are two Bronsons on display here: the impossible thug that we don’t dare release into polite society, and the guy we enjoy watching do his terrible thing. The man and the movie are both living, punching contradictions.</snippet>

         <snippet>He's neither victim nor hero, but a man who, in every conceivable sense, belongs behind bars.</snippet>

         <snippet>Refn has somehow found his way to an authentic English hard-man drama, anchored in a dynamite performance, even as it celebrates thug life.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is unhinged genius, an amazing piece of acting. Brutal, yes, but magnetic all the same.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bronson isn’t a story in the traditional sense at all. It’s a meditation on the art of rage - an action painting passing itself off as an action movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's played with real zest and energy, and if you can stand the heat it gives off it may charm you despite yourself.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hardy is remarkable, however. This is an actor with a memorably expressive rasp of a voice, both blunt and musical.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tom Hardy gives an amazing performance as Peterson, who took on the nickname Charlie Bronson, after the "Death Wish" actor.</snippet>

         <snippet>The tone is surreal, at once visceral and clinical, making Bronson an unsettling experience: savage, disturbing, and yet somehow fascinating.</snippet>

         <snippet>With an intelligent, provocative and stylized approach, Bronson (based on a true story) follows the metamorphosis of Mickey Peterson into Britain's most dangerous prisoner, Charles Bronson.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's lively and vivid but ends up leaving the viewer indifferent to the central character, his life, and his dubious place in British pop culture.</snippet>

         <snippet>Too smart/arty for the slasher set, and too violent for high-brows, Bronson may have a tough time finding its niche, although it has "cult hit" written all over it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bronson is one of those “based on a true story” dramatizations where the theatrically staged drama only gets in the way of the more interesting truth.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bronson is essentially a faux-operatic, music hall turn--a larky, lumpen version of "Lola Montès."</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite the artistic flourishes, this is still an utterly repellent look at a psychopath who does not deserve the attention of the filmmakers or the audience.</snippet>
