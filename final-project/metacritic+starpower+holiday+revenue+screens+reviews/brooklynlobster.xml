         <snippet>The triumph here is the natural, fluid way the characters interact, many of them displaying real-life, quirky senses of humor you don't often find in screenplays.</snippet>

         <snippet>The kind of smart, realistic indie family drama the movies should give us more often, just as they should more often offer performances as full-blooded and rich as Aiello's and Curtin's here.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sweet and touching film, worth a visit.</snippet>

         <snippet>However fact-based the material may be, Jordan's salt-of-the-earth characters, with their bluster and pride and rough-edged loyalty, are all too familiar, and their travails feel formulaic, right down to the life-affirming climax.</snippet>

         <snippet>Character's multiple mid-life crises could make this genuinely engaging drama especially appealing to older viewers.</snippet>

         <snippet>An unusually pure example of American kitchen-sink realism.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately has the air of a home movie project blown up to feature-length proportions.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kevin Jordan (Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire), a protege of Martin Scorsese, wrote and directed this dull 2005 autobiographical feature; it feels real, but solid performances fail to enliven the characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fails to dig out the dramatic meat, despite a yeoman performance by Danny Aiello.</snippet>

         <snippet>Outside of the Jordan inner circle, this family-versus-business parable comes across as slight, familiar, and in dire need of seasoning.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the Giorgios were more interesting, perhaps Brooklyn Lobster would feel less sluggish. But as it is, the crustaceans' unhappy destinies are more compelling than the colorless lives of their captors.</snippet>
