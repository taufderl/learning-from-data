         <snippet>Trendy influence of insidiously creepy Japanese horror pics is felt in almost every frame of Boogeyman. The effectively atmospheric and unusually involving thriller tells the story of a distraught young man's protracted duel of wits with the eponymous evildoer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Stephen T. Kay (The Last Time I Committed Suicide) busts off some cool shots, and Eric Kripke's story is pretty sound until the finale. Worth a look for horror fans, but nothing classic.</snippet>

         <snippet>It suffers from a lack of genuine chills or suspense that renders its slight virtues rather moot.</snippet>

         <snippet>This film does cause shivers, creeps, scares, and jumps. It may even make you scream a bit.</snippet>

         <snippet>An otherwise passable horror film that delivers more than enough cheap thrills to forgive the plot holes.</snippet>

         <snippet>While stylishly filmed and edited, Boogeyman is filled with every imaginable fright cliche... It's like a meal consisting entirely of airy hors d'oeuvres.</snippet>

         <snippet>A film willing to cheat whatever way necessary to scare you... The good news is that once you leave the theatre, you'll never think of Boogeyman again.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is strictly substandard stuff, with imitative creepy noises, vertiginous camera angles, and long pauses.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mostly Boogeyman remains content to be a film about a boogeyman who hides in closets and under beds and gobbles people up. And for that, it deserves a certain amount of respect. On the other hand, the film could hardly be any sillier.</snippet>

         <snippet>The filmmakers are smart enough to keep the monster out of sight for a long time and then to show only glimpses, but a similar tactic of providing only glimpses of plot and character is disastrous.</snippet>

         <snippet>The MPAA's rating explanation for this PG-13-rated snoozer misleadingly claims it contains "intense sequences of terror/violence"; it would be more accurate to state that Boogeyman contains "virtually every horror-movie cliché of the past 30 years."</snippet>

         <snippet>It's difficult to remember a recent movie with less regard for spatial or temporal coherence. With the bar set so low, one wouldn't think the ending could possibly come as a letdown. Believe me, it does.</snippet>

         <snippet>A horror film whose only scare is that it was made at all... As with so many stupid horror movies in these post-''Scream" times, this one is at such a creative loss that all it can do is make its audience feel duped for having purchased a ticket.</snippet>
