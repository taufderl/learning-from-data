         <snippet>The grandeur of the effects--the honest-to-God spectacle of the thing--elevates Monsters vs. Aliens to something approaching art. It's not a masterpiece, but it's most certainly a milestone.</snippet>

         <snippet>The richly multilayered picture tends to have a gently immersive effect, akin to a stroll through the world's most expensive diorama.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie may best be appreciated by people who know the references. All five monsters come from low-budget science fiction films of the 1950s.</snippet>

         <snippet>In fact "nice" is the adjective that seems to surface most in trying to pin down the film's most salient quality, which means that while the film is enjoyable enough, it is unlikely to become a classic for us, or a "Shrek" sort of franchise for DreamWorks.</snippet>

         <snippet>Children won't get the references to atomic-age monster movies, but the film offers more than nostalgia: there are slyly funny performances by Seth Rogen as an omnivorous blue blob and Stephen Colbert as the U.S. president, who faces down, and then flees, an alien invasion.</snippet>

         <snippet>On some level, the latest DreamWorks CGI project isn't a movie so much as a gag-delivery system wrapped in special effects. The story is crammed with incident, yet completely trifling; there are a ton of personalities, but no real characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Monsters vs. Aliens suffers from the common 3D problems: dim lighting, poor focus in fast-paced action sequences, and too many distractions for the movie to grab the viewer.</snippet>

         <snippet>The 3D visuals are an enormous part of MVA's experience and they also help to cover up the lackluster “comedy.”</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie works hard -- desperately hard -- to be all things to all audience segments. And the visible effort erodes the sense of gaiety, of unfettered fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>After a while, you can see the setups happening -- and once you do, the careening gets predictable. Which gets old, really fast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even in 3D, as the picture is being shown in some theaters -- Ginormica is a disappointingly flat character.</snippet>

         <snippet>As I took off my gray-lensed 3-D spectacles at the end of Monsters vs. Aliens, I felt not so much immersed as fuzzy with exhaustion. What I had seen struck me less as a herald of shining possibility than as a thrill ride back to the future--back, that is, to an idea of the future, and a stale one at that.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is curiously unmemorable, partly because nearly all of its humor depends on your having seen something like it before, even if you haven't.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has bells and whistles, superb technical sophistication and dazzling visual effects, sound, fury and Reese Witherspoon. What it doesn't have is heart. Like so many vehicles that have popped out from the DreamWorks Animation snark tank, Monsters vs. Aliens is too clever by half.</snippet>

         <snippet>This action-comedy will seem fresh only to 8-year-olds -- though it may give parents an excuse to introduce some of the '50s horror movies it parodies.</snippet>
