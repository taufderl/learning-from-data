         <snippet>Lohan is superfluous to the qualities that elevate the film above other Clearasil comedies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has the feel of a contemporary screwball romance, if not the crackling one-liners of classic screwball. But Lindsay Lohan and Chris Pine make a charming star-crossed couple, and tweens and teens will find enough plot reversals to keep them hooked.</snippet>

         <snippet>All this might be forgivable if Just My Luck had a little more substance, but it never moves beyond the single joke of its premise.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just My Luck is a bit of lukewarm cappuccino froth confected to float Ms. Lohan to the next stage of her career.</snippet>

         <snippet>Helmer Donald Petrie seems at times to be making the modern-day equivalent of a Doris Day comedy, setting the pic in a lacquered fantasy New York, piling on cutesy-coy dialogue and mining a fluffy premise for all manner of far-fetched cleverness.</snippet>

         <snippet>An occasionally entertaining, always fluffy teen romantic comedy with some moderately funny physical comedy by gadabout star Lindsay Lohan.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whimsical fantasy tends to work best when its premise is used sparingly, but in this case the fantasy element takes over the story, becoming mechanical and often confused.</snippet>

         <snippet>Looking tired and sallow and drained of her customary glow, Lindsay Lohan marches grimly through this mechanical tween comedy as if it were a particularly tedious homework assignment. Which it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Presumably, this movie was designed to be a fun romp, and in that it fails.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lohan's good work in movies like "Mean Girls" and the "Freaky Friday" remake is a faint memory as she struggles through antics, unfunny pratfalls and squirmingly bad set pieces.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just my luck that I saw the trailer for the film several times and already knew all of this, which made the long-form version of the movie redundant.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just My Luck, a lazy spitballing session of karmic humor, hinged on the sort of generic rom-com contrivances that keep movies like these from ending at a reasonable time.</snippet>

         <snippet>The picture gives us two protagonists and sets up a situation in which only one of them can have a decent life. Then, having devised this sour souffle, the screenwriters find no adjustment to make it palatable. The resolution is flip, at best.</snippet>

         <snippet>This mangy comedy only demonstrates that Lohan's star power is too bright for falling into mounds of mud, rooting around in cat litter for a contact lens, and getting punched out by a roughneck jailbird, as she does here.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just My Luck is way too long for such a slight premise, and Lohan, so appealing in Mean Girls, is years too young for the part.</snippet>

         <snippet>The kind of film that's too romantic for younger viewers and too redundant for young teens. For both sets, the laughs come infrequent (if at all), no thanks to Lohan giving another sub par performance.</snippet>

         <snippet>No doubt this film will please the pre-teen set, but they'd be so much better off staying home and renting "Mean Girls."</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, I can't think of a movie that matters less than Just My Luck. It's just negligible.</snippet>
