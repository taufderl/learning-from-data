         <snippet>Although the film begins promisingly, it proves to be little more than a soap opera.</snippet>

         <snippet>More thoughtful than its cookie-cutter marketing campaign implies, and better than its awful title promises, "Love Happens" is the rare Hollywood romance concerned with emotions other than love at first sight.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film contains almost no rough edges; thanks to decades of previous use, just about every shot and sequence is as polished as a riverbed stone.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eckhart has even less chemistry with Aniston than he did with fellow narcissist Catherine Zeta-Jones in 2007’s "No Reservations," going soft and gooey only when he and Martin Sheen, as Burke’s father-in-law, share a big cry.</snippet>

         <snippet>An incredibly lazy movie -- but not an unbearable one, thanks to Aaron Eckhart's charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>Love Happens announces itself as a romantic comedy but doesn't speak the language of love. Instead, it trades in the slogans of self-help procedural.</snippet>

         <snippet>Excise the love story, and there's a pretty good movie buried within Love Happens struggling to get out, mostly to little avail.</snippet>

         <snippet>Love Happens is an oddly upbeat title for a movie that is surprisingly sad.</snippet>

         <snippet>That this superficial romance between a successful self-help author and a nurturing florist is also a film about overcoming the tragedy of losing a loved one only makes its clichéd insipidity that much more irksome.</snippet>

         <snippet>If that's the best Hollywood screenwriters can do, maybe they should sign up for a self-help seminar. Nothing focuses the mind like a little firewalking.</snippet>

         <snippet>Is this a movie or a feature-length advertisement for Qwest? We're not just talking one product placement; this brand name is nearly omnipresent.</snippet>

         <snippet>I wish the movie made emotional sense, because it’s all about getting in touch with whatever’s holding you back, but it doesn’t.</snippet>

         <snippet>Structurally, this is as by-the-numbers as rom-coms get, right down to the wacky best friends, played by Judy Greer and Dan Fogler. For a while, it's low-key enough to be tolerable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The dialogue is often grating, and some of the situations are distastefully cute, although John Carroll Lynch (Fargo) has a strong supporting turn as a grief workshop client.</snippet>

         <snippet>Some may wonder why Jennifer Aniston keeps taking projects about single women unlucky in love. But the bigger question in Love Happens is why, with her pick of scripts, she chose one so utterly uninspired.</snippet>

         <snippet>No authentic emotion of any kind happens in this damp, Seattle-based romance, a fizzle for both stars.</snippet>

         <snippet>It might sound intriguing to root the saying, "Physician, heal thyself," in the plight of a hypocritical self-help guru, but the romantic drama Love Happens suffers from acute irony deficiency.</snippet>

         <snippet>Love Happens? It depends on your definition of “love.” And “happens.” There isn’t much of either in this predictable, putzy drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a limp romantic drama that occasionally lifts its drowsy head to attempt a wan smile, a picture that starts out being harmlessly dull and ends, somehow, in a place that feels insultingly manipulative.</snippet>
