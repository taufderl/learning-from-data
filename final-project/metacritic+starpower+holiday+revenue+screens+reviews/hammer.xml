         <snippet>It's genuinely funny, oddly romantic and surprisingly engaging for what could easily have been an obnoxious vanity project.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Hammer benefits from Carolla's low-energy, low-impact style. He doesn't so much deliver quips as let them dribble out the side of his mouth.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nothing groundbreaking, but there's an easy charm in the movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>What you have here, essentially, is a classic "Honeymooners" episode juiced with tropes from the most recent "Rocky" movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>The script depends heavily on familiar stand-up comedy bits, but it's full of sharp wisecracks and slacker charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>Rambling and disorganized. At the same time, though, The Hammer also has dry wit and unforced working-class swagger, and hits some surprising emotional notes.</snippet>

         <snippet>So many movies these days are overworked or overblown: The Hammer feels genuinely tossed-off. It isn't a great movie, or even a consistently good one. Yet it gets to elusive feelings about failure and success, hope and mortality (and reveals a quietly subversive attitude toward the boxing-movie genre).</snippet>

         <snippet>This inordinately likable and consistently funny boxing saga-cum-romantic comedy doesn't so much ridicule the "Rocky"-type inspirational sports fable as gently deflate its heroic overdrive.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film hardly could be credited with breaking any new ground, but it has a hangdog charm, much like its leading actor.</snippet>

         <snippet>Former "Loveline" and "The Man Show" co-host Adam Carolla brings his self-deprecating, improvisational, regular-dude deadpan--as well as his former Golden Gloves status--to this semi-autobiographical comedy with ambitions so low that one might call it charmingly mediocre.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you liked "Rocky Balboa" you should be in good shape, since it's exactly the same movie, just aimed at a teeny-tiny-bit younger demographic and with an affectless leading man who avoids hambone acting by not acting at all.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plays like a pilot for a situation comedy about a 40-year-old carpenter who decides to return to the boxing ring.</snippet>
