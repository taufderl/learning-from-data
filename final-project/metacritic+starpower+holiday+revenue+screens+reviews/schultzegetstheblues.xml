         <snippet>Filmed in a leisurely, understated style, this dark comedy is downright entrancing. A spectacular directorial debut.</snippet>

         <snippet>The writer and director, Michael Schorr, is making his first film, but has the confidence and simplicity of someone who has been making films forever.</snippet>

         <snippet>A delightfully deadpan comedy from Germany, is one of those movies where nothing whatsoever seems to happen until you look closely, at which point everything happens.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's the warmest, most generous portrait of American hospitality you've seen from a European movie in some time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Michael Schorr's delightfully deadpan comedy debut blew away the German box office, and once you let yourself sink into its gentle rhythms, as slow and deliberate as those of its protagonist and inflected with tiny but significant shifts of pace and tone, you'll see why.</snippet>

         <snippet>With dialogue as spare as its harsh landscapes, the film is so tonally dry that it makes Aki Kaurismäki look like the Farrelly brothers--it begins at a snail's pace before speeding up to a turtle's drowsy crawl.</snippet>

         <snippet>Krause is completely believeable as the solid old man, and though the story moves slower than molasses, it leaves the same dark aftertaste.</snippet>

         <snippet>Schultze has a spare style, deliberately slow pace, and so little dialogue that to say it's in German with English subtitles seems to be stretching the truth.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sweet German movie by a first-time filmmaker, who, I would bet, is more than a little familiar with the early work of Jim Jarmusch or just about any Aki KaurismŠki film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Simply too tedious and stretched out to be amusing. Had Schorr brought in his picture at 80 or 90 minutes Schultze might have been a different story.</snippet>

         <snippet>Krause is very nearly too passive. Deadpan is one thing, an empty vessel is another.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a good thing the movie has so little dialogue, because when it talks, the words dilute its almost surreal visual spell, and the fructose turns to saccharine.</snippet>
