         <snippet>I liked these characters precisely because they were not designed to be likable -- or, more precisely, because they were likable in spite of being exasperating, unorganized, self-destructive and impervious to good advice.</snippet>

         <snippet>In "Upside" Allen's marble face acts as the pressure-cooker lid on a hilarious hissy fit.</snippet>

         <snippet>In making such an appealing movie about characters who are usually swept under the Hollywood rug, Binder does us all a service.</snippet>

         <snippet>A squarely suburban movie with a distinctly bourgeois-shaped window on the world, but it's genuine and exceptionally well observed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Allen turns the character into a tour de force that unleashes an unexpected comedy about compassion and self-loathing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Increasingly exhibits a desire to amuse and distract rather than go deep, which ultimately generates disappointment in light of its announced intentions.</snippet>

         <snippet>One senses that this is an intensely personal project for Binder, who is not as forgiving as he might be toward the mercurial mother. Still, the film is carried by Costner and Allen, who project a chemistry so incrementally built on reluctant camaraderie, they almost seem like siblings.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Allen owns The Upside of Anger, she is generous enough to loan it to Costner, who, despite the dim, glazed eyes, is more alive here than he's been in years.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Upside of Anger belongs to Joan Allen (for whom director/screenwriter Mike Binder developed the project).</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The Upside of Anger is overly therapized, yet Costner and Allen show you what it means not just to play a role but to inhabit it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Joan Allen, for whom the role was written, combines severity, which she has often played before, with such levity and verve that she lifts the whole film on the wings of Terry's wrath.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's best about "Upside" is its gonzo-sitcom craziness, a situation that lends itself to enjoyable performances.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>This loses focus and begins to get a little soggy and moralistic toward the end, but on the whole it's a sensitive and well-observed comedy that's especially adept at handling the characters' rage.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The film never earns the irony of the title or offers anything profound in its observations of fractured family dynamics in an atmosphere of lingering resentment, but Allen and Costner enrich and elevate the film and give the growth of their characters a hard-earned gravitas.</snippet>

         <snippet>Costner does things he hasn't done in years: He's funny and playful; he laughs and cracks jokes; and he doesn't look like he's carrying the weight of the universe on his shoulders.</snippet>

         <snippet>Binder has allowed Allen, a brilliant actress, to go overboard with Terry's obnoxiousness, just as Brooks (his apparent role model) did with TÃ©a Leoni in "Spanglish."</snippet>
