         <snippet>Sometimes the only funny stuff is in the trailers, but not so here. Kristen Johnson was especially adept at stealing some scenes.</snippet>

         <snippet>A chick flick in the purest sense--it's not about men or falling in love--and is quite funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bride Wars is pretty thin soup. The characters have no depth or personality, no quirks or complications, no conversation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bride Wars pretends to be a satire of wedding mania, but since there's virtually nothing else to the movie, the satire comes depressingly close to endorsement.</snippet>

         <snippet>A step backward for Hathaway, Bride Wars is one more step into the quicksand for Hudson, who's spent the nine years since ""Almost Famous wandering the rom-com wasteland in search of an exit strategy; this movie, which she exec produced, ain't it.</snippet>

         <snippet>A chick flick that makes its chick characters - and by extension its chick audience - look like hateful, backward toddlers, and there is something wrong with that.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bride Wars really does not capture the mood of the moment. It comes from a different time, a different planet.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like moussed hair and inverted-pyramid shoulder pads, this sloppy, sloppy slapstick is an artifact from the 1980s.</snippet>

         <snippet>It represents a missed opportunity on every level. As a black comedy, it fails. As a satire of the bloated wedding industry, it fails. As a drama about friendship triumphing over all, it fails.</snippet>

         <snippet>With artifice as layered as the tiers of a marzipan cake, this resembles nothing so much as a stale Rock Hudson-Doris Day comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>No cues are needed to understand the plot, which feels computer-generated and barely serves to sustain an hour and a half running time.</snippet>

         <snippet>The idea of a revenge comedy isn't necessarily a bad one, Bride Wars simply fails at it despite having the formidable duo of Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway, who in their own distinctive ways usually command the screen.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bride Wars has possibly the worst comedy idea since "Springtime for Hitler," with almost no room for redeeming camp.</snippet>

         <snippet>All in all, that's not a bad premise for a lightweight chick flick, but director Gary Winick and an army of three screenwriters can't come up with a single fresh comedic idea.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never gets off its high-concept stool long enough to explore what makes weddings so exciting and nerve-racking and treacherous. It flounders instead in juvenilia and bitchiness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Predictable, lazy and as overprocessed as Kate Hudson's hair, this thoroughly joyless movie also possesses a deep nasty streak, making it loathsome when it might have been merely annoying.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's both slack and bloated; I've been to Catholic wedding masses that had more zip. I think it clocked in at fewer than 90 minutes, but it seemed to last longer than most marriages do.</snippet>

         <snippet>There may be a trenchant satire to be mined from our culture's materialism-warped wedding madness, but Bride Wars instead opts for graceless, flailing, poorly choreographed slapstick performed by characters who suggest a dumbed-down tour production of "Sex And The City."</snippet>

         <snippet>The first big-studio movie released in 2009 has a damn fine chance of being the worst. Bride Wars isn't just chick-flick hell for guys, it should numb the skulls of moviegoers of all sexes and ages.</snippet>
