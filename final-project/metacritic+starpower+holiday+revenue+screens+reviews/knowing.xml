         <snippet>Knowing is among the best science-fiction films I've seen -- frightening, suspenseful, intelligent and, when it needs to be, rather awesome.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a severely flawed, but also a fascinating and engrossing science fiction film, a picture that offers far more than surface thrills.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's just engaging enough to make you accept the possibility that two kids from the Boston suburbs may just be mankindâ€™s only hope for the future, and just exciting enough to make you forget that you're watching a Nicolas Cage movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>By being judicious with CGI, Proyas gives the film's handful of disaster sequences great impact.</snippet>

         <snippet>Genre fans always looking for something new and awesome may feel like they've seen most of this before, but the conceptual and emotional strength of Summit's Nicolas Cage starrer largely carries the day.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yes, Knowing is creepy, at least for the first two-thirds or so, in a moderately satisfying, if predictable, way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Early scenes of mayhem and destruction are marred by subpar special effects; those in the final reel are spectacular, but there's a long wait for them because the movie is so maddeningly, portentously slow.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whatever else Proyas has done in Knowing, he has created an ending that is sure to divide audiences into camps of love it or hate it, deeming its message either hopeful or hopelessly heavy-handed. For me, it doesn't quite work; still I'm glad he took the risk.</snippet>

         <snippet>Knowing has about a half-dozen screenwriter credits, which may explain why scenes crash up against one another - smart, stupid, far-fetched, compelling. And the trouble is that Cage walks (or runs) through them all, treating each with the same level of intensely goofy seriousness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Until it jumps the tracks into self-righteousness, though, Knowing, directed by Alex Proyas, can also be as unnerving as the best episodes of "The Twilight Zone."</snippet>

         <snippet>Reviewers sometimes insult actors by saying they don't vary their expressions across an entire movie. But until Knowing, I never thought that could literally be true. Nicolas Cage does widen his eyes with about 15 minutes left in the film.</snippet>

         <snippet>What would a Christian Apocalypse movie look like with a big budget, a talented director, and star power of higher wattage than a discount Baldwin brother? Here comes the answer: like a glum hybrid of the "Final Destination" movies, an Irwin Allen disaster bash, and the kitschiest parts of Darren Aronofsky's "The Fountain."</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Alex Proyas resolutely thinks in B-movie terms. Even with an A-list budget, he oversells every plot point and gooses the thrills with hokey lighting, bombastic music and serious overacting.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you see only one bad movie this year, definitely make it Knowing. The first major disappointment from director Alex Proyas is a disaster movie, a horror picture, a "Da Vinci Code"-style thriller and an end-of-days religious film all at once.</snippet>
