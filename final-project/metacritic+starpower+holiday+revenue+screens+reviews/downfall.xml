         <snippet>One of the best war movies ever made, Downfall is a powerful and artistically masterful re-creation of the last days of the Third Reich.</snippet>

         <snippet>A riveting re-creation of three world-changing collapses: those of the Nazi party, of militarized Germany as a whole, and of the Führer who guided them into self-destructive ruin.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hirschbiegel and Eichinger, along with their large, brave and talented cast, have done something extraordinary for their generation of Germans, and for the world. They have willfully entered their grandparents' dirtiest, clammiest chamber of secrets.</snippet>

         <snippet>Downfall, whatever its shortcomings, bears strong witness to great evil. That is its triumph as a film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Against the overarching facts of his personal magnetism and the blind loyalty of his lieutenants, the movie observes the workings of the world within the bunker. All power flowed from Hitler. He was evil, mad, ill, but long after Hitler's war was lost he continued to wage it in fantasy.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a bracing reminder that before Hitler took power, it was handed to him. The lesson resonates long after the credits roll.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a piece of acting, Ganz’s work is not just astounding, it’s actually rather moving. But I have doubts about the way his virtuosity has been put to use.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not so much a Hitler movie as a portrait of a totalitarian machine's spiritual and emotional collapse, Downfall is a cumulatively powerful Goetterdammerung centered on the last 10 days of the bunkered Fuehrer and those around him.</snippet>

         <snippet>The reality it confronts is so gripping, we cannot turn away. This may not be the most sophisticated retelling of what happened while Berlin burned, but what a story it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Indeed, Hirschbiegel himself seems reluctant to single out a protagonist, and finally settles on Junge.</snippet>

         <snippet>Downfall's overstuffed melodrama juggles countless subplots and a small army of characters who manage to make an impression in spite of limited screen time.</snippet>

         <snippet>With a steely, unblinking resolve, Downfall stares into the abyss, but does not pretend to comprehend it.</snippet>

         <snippet>If I respect Downfall more than I was enthralled by it, that's because its portayal stops short of revelation. Once you witness Hitler's denial, the film has little more to say about him.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is fascinating without being especially illuminating, and it holds your attention for its very long running time without delivering much dramatic or emotional satisfaction in the end.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>This is a grim and sometimes guilt-ridden examination of the Third Reich in collapse. But it's also weirdly sympathetic, and not just to the peripheral figures in Hitler's twisted world.</snippet>

         <snippet>That's the problem of Downfall in a nutshell: It provokes insufficient emotional and intellectual responses to a grotesque and atrocious dictatorship. Instead of the banality of evil, it gives us the banality of banality.</snippet>

         <snippet>Downfall may be grimly self-important and inescapably trivializing. But we should be grateful that German cinema is more inclined to normalize the nation's history than rewrite it.</snippet>
