         <snippet>To see Perfect Stranger is to wish for a more sophisticated vehicle for a film actress this good, but actors -- and audiences -- take what they can get. This is better than most.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perfect Stranger is far from Hitchcock, and Berry, although she gets an A for effort, can't do much with the half-baked characterizations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Todd Komarnicki's screenplay relies heavily on red herrings and a host of suspects (there are more murderers swanning around Hill's sleek offices than there were aboard the Orient Express) to keep audiences distracted from what, in retrospect, is really pretty obvious.</snippet>

         <snippet>Instead of heightening the intrigue in this psychological thriller, the labored twists and out-of-leftfield turns will leave audiences more weary than wary.</snippet>

         <snippet>A rarely suspenseful thriller with a twist ending of the worst kind: It takes too much explanation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perfect Stranger is one of those movies that two years, or two months, from now, you won't recall having seen. Ostensibly a movie about big secrets, it comes up with few that are worth keeping, or telling.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is an acceptable enough thriller, neither the worst you've seen nor the opposite.</snippet>

         <snippet>It lacks the rutting nuttiness of "Basic Instinct," even as it recycles much of that film's kiss-or-kill premise.</snippet>

         <snippet>The only surprise here is the real star of the show, who turns out to be not Halle Berry, not even Bruce Willis, but a flat computer screen in all its hard-driven glory.</snippet>

         <snippet>When the left-field ending finally arrives, it explains a lot, including why she's so off-putting and histrionic, but it never really explains why audiences should bother sitting through such a tangled mess.</snippet>

         <snippet>Joins the growing list of blandly made erotic thrillers that contain no eroticism, few thrills and fewer likable characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perfect Stranger derives some novelty value from its colorblind casting and from being the most ludicrously silly Hollywood f----fest since the Willis-starring "Color of Night" (minus that movie's comic self-awareness). But as a thriller, it's so by-the-numbers that it's hardly worth keeping count.</snippet>

         <snippet>A disorienting cocktail of illogic and hysteria that requires an 11th-hour soliloquy just to explain what's happened.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The director, as he showed in movies like "After Dark, My Sweet," and "Fear," specializes in conjuring conspiratorial atmospheres in which anxiety and sexual menace hang in the air like a heavy, bitter perfume. Long after you've dismissed the movie's ridiculous, convoluted story, traces of that scent may linger.</snippet>
