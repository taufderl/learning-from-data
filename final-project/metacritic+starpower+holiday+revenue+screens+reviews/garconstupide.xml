         <snippet>An intriguing examination of alienation and dysfunction, tonally haunting rather than melodramatic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Composed of artfully used split-screen, lots of hand-held camera, and expertly honed dialogue, the film floats on currents of sadness and understated humor. It also makes Loic's existential ache almost palpable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Loic's journey is rich in incident and detail, and Garçon Stupide retains its dynamic momentum throughout.</snippet>

         <snippet>A caveat to viewers: This brand of movie sex, as directed by 30-year-old Lionel Baier, is emphatically not for the puritanical.</snippet>

         <snippet>Raw, uncompromising and surprisingly explicit.</snippet>

         <snippet>Until the lean script by Baier and Laurent Guido takes some unconvincing turns in the late going, the film is a credible portrait of alienation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Baier's interweaving of documentary-style sequences with poetic, dreamlike imagery underscores the competition between Loic's harsh external circumstance and his lyrical internal yearnings for a better life.</snippet>

         <snippet>Garçon Stupide is interesting enough to merit an audience broader than its intended niche, though it isn't perfect.</snippet>

         <snippet>Garçon Stupide was shot on digital video and is the rare piece of European sexual realism centered completely on a boy's awakening.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Baier's style is almost uncomfortably voyeuristic, amplified by the casting of a young, inexperienced actor (Pierre Chatagny) in a part that calls for hardcore sex.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a better-late-than-never coming-of-age tale that is by turns earnest and corny, though never stupide.</snippet>

         <snippet>The real struggle here isn't so much Chatagny's slow emergence into maturity as Lionel Baier's directorial struggle to balance artful and erotic elements.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mostly it's tedious as we watch the photogenic but emotionally blank Chatagny bounce between anonymous sexual encounters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Should we really be so moved and uplifted that a horny, ignorant young man begins to join the human race? Not when our voice of conscience is an off-screen filmmaker issuing pseudo-profound, and ultimately banal, pronouncements about the true nature of love and seduction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Garcon Stupide features the best gay seduction scene ever filmed on a Ferris wheel. Unfortunately, you have to sit through the entire movie to get to it. Whether you want to will depend on your interest in explicit gay sex.</snippet>
