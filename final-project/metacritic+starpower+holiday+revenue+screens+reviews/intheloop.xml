         <snippet>The language is brilliant, and the laugh lines come so quickly that you'd probably have to watch the movie twice to get them all.</snippet>

         <snippet>The chattering smarty-pants who ran the U.S. government on "The West Wing" are slow talkers compared with the motormouthed and hilariously imperfect power elite in the brainy British comedy In the Loop.</snippet>

         <snippet>In The Loop floats above its chaotic world on wave after wave of beautifully profane dialogue.</snippet>

         <snippet>Zooming back and forth between London and D.C., In the Loop hasn't any real plot -- it plays like a rather brilliant Brit-com stretched over 100 minutes, a collection of anecdotes and incidents.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not to detract from the pleasure of watching the consistently excellent actors, who enhance the dialogue's bite with their body language, but the script of In the Loop is so rich that it could work as a radio play.</snippet>

         <snippet>Britain's diplomatic corps may be as clueless and impotent as In the Loop suggests, but British comedians are fully capable of taking over the world.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tremendous fun at times, especially in its vicious power plays and betrayals. But it has no redeeming value beyond entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sharply written, fast-talking, almost dementedly articulate satire on modern statecraft.</snippet>

         <snippet>The performances are explosively funny, from Hollander's increasingly bewildered and way-out-of-his-depth Simon to Chris Addison's hapless PR fledgling. But the star is Peter Capaldi.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is absolutely hilarious, a satire as brisk and fleet as a farce and as profane as a convention of Tony Montana impersonators.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dancing along a line just shy of the edge of brilliance, In the Loop possesses an incisive, take-no-prisoners comedic style that offers plenty of solid laughs while making a point about the stupidity, selfishness, and lack of awareness that exists within the highest echelons of government.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the Loop is certainly the smartest and funniest movie inspired by the Iraq war.</snippet>

         <snippet>Laugh you will, loud and often. In the Loop deserves to be a sleeper hit. The whole cast is stellar. And it proves that smart and funny can exist in the same movie, even in summer.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a ranking cabinet minister in the brutally funny political satire In the Loop, actor Peter Capaldi unfurls dazzling verbal ribbons of the foulest language imaginable, thunderbolts of vulgarity that carry the force of precision carpet-bombing.</snippet>

         <snippet>While director Armando Iannucci's brand of satire -- just plausible enough to be painful -- isn't for all tastes, it's a little bit of heaven to hear screen characters spew such eloquently vicious bile.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's also a British comedy, with that singularly British way of being clever and deliriously juvenile all at once, a combination that makes for scathing, laugh-out-loud, big-screen satire.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the Loop is clever and lively, but it isn't sharp or nasty enough to cut very deep; at best it's just a peppery trifle.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s the hilarious tumble of words--the sly cultural references, astonishingly creative invective, the veritable arias of profanity--that gives the film an unexpected heft.</snippet>
