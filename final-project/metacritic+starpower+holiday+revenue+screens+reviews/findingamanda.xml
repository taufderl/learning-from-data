         <snippet>This dark comedy of addiction, delusion and humor as a weapon marks the feature directing debut of veteran writer Peter Tolan.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the title "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" didnâ€™' already belong to Hunter S. Thompson, it would perfectly fit Peter Tolan's viciously funny satire, Finding Amanda.</snippet>

         <snippet>By keeping the tone light, the players human (Steve Coogan has a nice turn as a greasy casino host), and never, ever romanticizing the addict, Finding Amanda comes by its heartbreak honestly.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's amusing but facile, reasonably clever but hopelessly glib.</snippet>

         <snippet>Broderick is splendid as the gambler. He knows, as many addicts do, that the addictive personality is very inward, however much acting out might take place.</snippet>

         <snippet>Broderick has the film's most clever lines, but Snow is quite funny and is convincing as an innocent lured by the promise of easy money.</snippet>

         <snippet>Much of Finding Amanda doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, but at its best the still-boyish Broderick suggests his most famous character, Ferris Bueller, going through a midlife crisis.</snippet>

         <snippet>Finding Amanda isn't bad, and there is some smart, jagged humor.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Offers a steady supply of clever lines but suffers from the patina of self-loathing common to industry lifers and the unfortunate miscasting of straight-arrow Broderick as a depressed, cynical hack.</snippet>

         <snippet>A slight, modestly funny comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although it avoids overt moralizing or clunky lesson-learning, pic's careful balancing act between tragedy and comedy eventually becomes its sole raison d'etre.</snippet>

         <snippet>This debut picture never makes up its mind about what sort of comedy it wants to be. But at least it has one--a mind, that is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Finding Amanda is a minor movie for Broderick, but considering where it takes him, it's understandable why he took the role.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even the easygoing Broderick can't inject any lift or charm into the story.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tolan writes regularly for smart shows like "Rescue Me," but his best instincts deserted him when he set his sights on the big screen for the first time.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The problem comes largely in the conception of the hooker-niece character, Amanda, played by Brittany Snow. Tolan never quite figures out whether she is supposed to be a variation on the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold or a genuinely troubled teen.</snippet>

         <snippet>Finding Amanda, unfortunately, is one vast, irritating surface.</snippet>
