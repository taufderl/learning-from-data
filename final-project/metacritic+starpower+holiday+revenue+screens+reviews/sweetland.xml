         <snippet>Sweet Land is a movie of extraordinary tenderness, in which Reaser and Guinee, using a language of looks, make you happy to think about what love once might have been.</snippet>

         <snippet>Directing with a light comic touch and a palpable affection for the characters, Selim draws pitch-perfect acting from a large cast  and achieves breathtaking levels of color and clarity from old-fashioned 35mm.</snippet>

         <snippet>Demonstrating a mastery of the medium that belies his status as a first-time feature filmmaker, writer-director Ali Selim has crafted in Sweet Land a tale of pure Americana that speaks both to the immigrant experience and the nature of love.</snippet>

         <snippet>Top honors go to Guinee, who steadily builds his character from tiny details, and Reaser, who's understood through eyes and attitude while speaking a hodgepodge of German, Norwegian and English.</snippet>

         <snippet>First-time director Ali Selim does an exceptional job throughout, his movie has the balance, uncluttered leanness and emotional impact of a Willa Cather short story, and it's no surprise that it has been nominated for Best First Feature in the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards.</snippet>

         <snippet>Once you get past the movie's needlessly fragmented framing device and its protracted introduction to a xenophobic rural Minnesota town, the core story gains some traction in your mind.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mark Orton's overused fiddly score is nice enough, but can't disguise the essential emptiness of overlong scenes.</snippet>
