         <snippet>Thanks largely to Tabatabai's superb performance, it's on this level that Maccarone's film is most affecting.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its deliberately overexposed film stock and driving electronic score, Ms. Maccarone's film occasionally suffers from a self-conscious artiness, but at its center is an extraordinary performance by Ms. Tabatabai as Fariba, a young woman whose expectations have been lowered by a lifetime of systematic mistreatment but who still holds out hope for the possibility of both justice and love.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tabatabai delivers a strong performance and the script, although not always plausible, touches on important issues like bias against gays and Muslims.</snippet>

         <snippet>The parts are more valuable than the whole in Angelina Maccarone's Unveiled.</snippet>

         <snippet>Several large leaps of faith take some of the dramatic steam out of Unveiled, an otherwise well-acted and accessible lesbian drama that also flirts with issues like loss of identity and anti-Muslim tensions.</snippet>

         <snippet>An Iranian version of "Boys Don't Cry,"  Unveiled overflows with sociopolitical outrage even if its portrayal of a gender-confused heroine is ultimately indecisive and laconic.</snippet>
