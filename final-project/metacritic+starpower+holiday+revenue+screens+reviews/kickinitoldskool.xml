         <snippet>Some of the humor is pretty raunchy (there are quite a few sex-related scenes and jokes) and tasteless. Adults old enough to appreciate the choice electro-boogaloo soundtrack and get the "Mr. Roboto" jokes will doubtless find the rest of it painfully dumb.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a film that has nothing to offer but lazy '80s nostalgia, Kickin' It Old Skool doesn't even bother to get the details right.</snippet>

         <snippet>A romantic subplot is formulaic, and, most disappointing, the break-dance sequences don't sizzle, though the film's director, Harvey Glazer, is known for his music videos. Keep an eye out, however, for some nutty cameos.</snippet>

         <snippet>Probably as tolerable as it can be for a comedy with no obvious creative aim. You can imagine the crew cracking up on some outtake reel, which honestly is what this movie feels like.</snippet>

         <snippet>An inauspicious feature debut for director Harv Glazer and all three scenarists, the "Big"-meets-breakdancing comedy will be kickin' it to ancillary by swimsuit season.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ineptitude of the movie's drama is matched only by the failure of its humor.</snippet>

         <snippet>A very stupid movie, with many more failed jokes than successful ones. Worse yet, much of the comedy is kind of mean.</snippet>

         <snippet>About eight minutes of this comedy is devoted to some terrific breakdancing; the rest consists of wall-to-wall product placement and politically incorrect bad-taste comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>As appealing as acid-washed jeans, Kickin' It Old Skool exists solely to provide employment for aggressively abrasive comic actor Jamie Kennedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>This ostensible comedy may be a new depths-of-hell low in the Emmanuel Lewis filmography, but for star Jamie Kennedy it’s par for the coarse.</snippet>

         <snippet>A pathetically unfunny comedy that should have been shipped straight to video, if not recycled as guitar picks.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kennedy’s humor comes from the broad, brainless, lowest-common-denominator school (in other words, he was born to play a grown man with the intelligence of an boy).</snippet>
