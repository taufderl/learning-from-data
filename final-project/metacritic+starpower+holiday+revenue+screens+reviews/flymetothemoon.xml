         <snippet>Will probably pass muster with very young viewers, but their parents may grit their teeth at its saccharine quality.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brisk and sweet, even if the script veers toward fussy and lame.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fly Me to the Moon is a crummy movie for kids, yet it still holds out the prospect of past wonders and future marvels. It's one small step for a housefly, one giant leap for 3-D.</snippet>

         <snippet>The animation IS great and absolutely so fantastic you'll want to reach out and touch the creatures - or swat them off your uncomfortable 3-D glasses.</snippet>

         <snippet>Would be totally unexceptional if not for its visual telling of the Apollo 11 flight and the fact that the movie is impressively shot - the first animated feature film in 3-D.</snippet>

         <snippet>The script appears to have been designed, created and produced entirely in 1-D: a mishmash of kidcentric antics, follow-your-dream cliches, and innocuously icky humor.</snippet>

         <snippet>An awkward mix of proficient 3-D animation, detailed technical recreation and strained storytelling that stalls on takeoff.</snippet>

         <snippet>Itâ€™s a wingless exercise, despite a rather heartening attitude toward space travel that will introduce young auds to the glory that was NASA in the '60s.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite some Cold War humor, the formulaic film is aimed squarely at the youngest of young children.</snippet>

         <snippet>Go to enjoy the technical expertise, and take a first-grader (and not a particularly savvy one) along to find something of value in everything else.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of the most undermotivated plots in many a moon, the zero-wit, zero-gravity misadventures of Nat, I.Q. and Scooter are embarked on merely because they're bored on their garbage dump.</snippet>

         <snippet>The little heroes and their families are surprisingly ugly, with faces resembling skulls, and the colors are so faded and muddy the movie feels tired and bungled.</snippet>

         <snippet>The vocal characterizations aren't the problem here; the script and the animation are the problems, and in feature animation, you can't arrange more significant problems than those.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film still suffers from cheap plasticky design, a klutzy overall look, dim preschooler humor, and a nearly impact-free story that thinks it's clever when it steals cues from 2001.</snippet>

         <snippet>Adding to weirdness is a tacked-on, live-action appearance from the real Aldrin, who reassures kids and terrified X-Files fans that there weren't, in fact, any houseflies on board Apollo 11.</snippet>

         <snippet>Forgive us for being demanding, but shouldn't an animated kids movie like this one be, at the very least, fun? Cute? Watchable?</snippet>
