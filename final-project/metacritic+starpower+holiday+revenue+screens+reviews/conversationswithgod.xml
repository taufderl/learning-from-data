         <snippet>It's an agreeable enough tale right up until God butts in and starts talking; even if you can swallow the premise, it isn't particularly cinematic to watch a guy endlessly scribbling on legal pads.</snippet>

         <snippet>Beyond a lack of enthralling characters or convincing plotting, though, what's most glaringly missing in this self-promotional marketing tool is, of all things, God, who gets only a bit role as Walsch's muse in a few scenes.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Simon's desire to feed the better angels of our nature is admirable, it would be nice if he could do it with better movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Walsch’s books have sold millions of copies, and his devotees may flock to this movie. Other seekers of enlightenment might prefer the 2004 New Age curiosity "What the Bleep Do We Know!?," whose playful sense of scientific inquiry is refreshing by comparison.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has some of the ring of truth, even though the movie lingers far too long over its own epiphanies.</snippet>

         <snippet>More polished and better acted than many "inspirational" biopics.</snippet>

         <snippet>If, like me, you haven't read this book, the movie makes little sense, and has zero inspirational kick. It's just a depressing parable about a fellow who sinks lower and lower in life until he figures out a nebulous new way to sell God to the masses.</snippet>

         <snippet>Conversations has all the telltale signs of a religious film that keep your basic moviegoer away: stilted dialogue, overwrought music, the subtlety of a daytime soap.</snippet>

         <snippet>Corny and harmless, Conversations With God is a humanistic little movie with a real belief in the power of redemption and a positive enough message: “Love is the answer.” Or: “Go to your Godspace.” Whichever speaks more clearly to you.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie itself frustrates by guarding the secret of Walsch's newfound spirituality.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of Walsch's precepts is that you should never make a living doing something you hate. If I'd known that, I might not have felt obliged to sit through every excruciating minute of this sanctimonious infomercial.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite valiant efforts from Czerny and from the fine stage actress Vilma Silva, who plays one of Walsch's many saviors, the result would qualify as a blandly inspirational amateur hour if the running time weren't closer to two.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie appears to be a contrived, poorly produced attempt to sell more of the author's books.</snippet>
