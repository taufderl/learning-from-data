         <snippet>It is Ferrell's best movie and the summer's funniest comedy so far.</snippet>

         <snippet>Will Ferrell does chicken-fried comedy right: with crackpot discipline and stripped-to-the-beer-belly courage.</snippet>

         <snippet>Talladega Nights may be brash, unbridled, even unhinged, but its cornpone humor is rich in parody, and its craftsmanship is superb -- smart writing, shrewd direction, precisely calibrated performances (whether the calibration calls for delicacy or broad-gauge burlesque), inventive language, inspired silliness and all-but-flawless timing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Reilly can play nuts, too, and in a lower gear that reins Ferrell in. They're a great team.</snippet>

         <snippet>The British star of "Ali G" fame plays Ricky Bobby's arch-nemesis. His name: Jean Girard. His provenance: France. His sponsor: Perrier. Speaking through a set of nasty-looking, tightly clenched teeth in the faux-est of faux French accents, Cohen is hilarious.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like "Anchorman," the secret to the inspired absurdity of Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is in the improv.</snippet>

         <snippet>We are treated to the riotous, almost David Lynchian moment in which Ferrell runs around a motorway in his undies screaming that he's on fire. He's not. Actually, come to think of it: He is.</snippet>

         <snippet>As good as a summer comedy about NASCAR has any right to be, with fine actors tucked into every nook and cranny.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a cultural artifact, Talladega Nights is both completely phony and, therefore, utterly authentic. Or, to put it differently: this movie is the real thing. It's finger lickin' good. It's eatin' good in the neighborhood. It's the King of Beers. It's Wonder Bread.</snippet>

         <snippet>From its pitch-perfect title through just about every detail, this sendup of sports-triumph movies maintains the right parodic pitch, if not always the highest mph on the laugh speedometer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Simultaneously teasing and loving a subject doesn't make for easy comedy, but writer-star Will Ferrell and director/co-writer Adam McKay pull it off with good-ol'-boy good nature in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ferrell reminds the audience of why he matters: because he's the loudest, driest, and most fearless comic actor working.</snippet>

         <snippet>When the crazy comes, it's pretty good crazy. Ferrell is in full-on brazen redneck mode, doing a variation on his "Saturday Night Live" George W. Bush impression.</snippet>

         <snippet>Silly, inconsistent, and completely frivolous, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby also happens to be one of the funniest movies this side of 2006.</snippet>

         <snippet>The laughs come and go, but Ferrell makes NASCAR his bitch funny. Funnier. And more fun. And then the fun skids to a stop. You know how it goes: Plot gets in the way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Comedy, of course, is a complicated dance between rhythm and timing, but Talladega Nights drags where it should be crackling and popping.</snippet>

         <snippet>On the Ferrellometer, Talladega Nights sits just above "Kicking &amp; Screaming," when it should be redlining it up there with "Anchorman."</snippet>

         <snippet>Monotonous. For while it offers a few precious laughs, Talladega Nights simply apes the look and feel of most recent Ferrell movies.</snippet>
