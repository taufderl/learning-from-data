         <snippet>A fine, exciting film that makes a bloody historical event live all over again by showing it through the eyes of children on the edges of the conflict.</snippet>

         <snippet>You don't have to know Chile's bloody history to be moved by the poignant new film Machuca, the first movie made by a Chilean about the country's 1973 military coup.</snippet>

         <snippet>Machuca is a quiet film, moving sadly toward its inevitable climax, the final scenes a lesson in the methods by which the military restores order to a divided country.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wood's film works, first and foremost, as a powerful character drama; it's not trying to teach historical or ideological lessons.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tender, funny and smart, Machuca is that rare discovery, an incisive political parable that also succeeds as a drama of sharply drawn individuals.</snippet>

         <snippet>Richly human in focus, the drama steadily cranks up its political and emotional charge.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sweet, poignant, and winningly evocative of the period, though occasionally dogged by predictable scenarios and caricatures.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a tale powerfully told, nevertheless, with an unusual vantage point in its upper-class young hero.</snippet>

         <snippet>Both sweet and stringent, attuned to the wonders of childhood as well as its cruelty and terror.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wood's drama packs an emotional gut-punch that's all the more devastating for its being rooted in a dreadful historical reality.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>A respectable entry in the Bicycle Thief school of art-house cinema, which uses a child's coming of age to explore an era of political and social turmoil.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though Machuca ultimately doesn't shy away from taking sides, it wisely keeps the focus on the human element. The politics take place in the background until they demand the foreground.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the film would benefit from further cuts, Machuca still manages to convey the frailty of convictions and the difficulties of growing up -- be it a child or a nation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Machuca is still a half-measure. Wood is fastidious about period set design, but not much else; rather than burning with experience, the film feels opportunistic.</snippet>
