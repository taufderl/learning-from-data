         <snippet>With these actors and Rodrigo Garc√≠a's sensitive direction, Passengers might have fared well as a short. But as a full-length feature, it's a long ride to a familiar destination.</snippet>

         <snippet>Turns out to be just another dud in the genre of revisionist mysteries that have been messing with our heads since Haley Joel Osment saw dead people. Only this time, the big reveal doesn't so much twist the plot as snap its neck.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cruising somewhere between therapy drama and paranoid thriller, this middlebrow tone poem aims for ambiguity but often veers into soporific, suspending answers (and often, viewer interest) en route to an ending that explains all.</snippet>

         <snippet>A clunky, dead-on-arrival scary drama that proves that even people with good taste need a good script or direction.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is a misfire, which you feel more acutely given the talents of those involved, including director Rodrigo Garcia ("Nine Lives," "Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her") and rising star Anne Hathaway.</snippet>

         <snippet>A kind of declawed, inside-out "Final Destination" -- with none of the sense of showmanship, and all the looming malice of a mawkish condolence card.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>A supernatural thriller so mechanically inept and lacking in suspense that it doesn't even pass muster as lowbrow Halloween-ready entertainment.</snippet>
