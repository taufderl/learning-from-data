         <snippet>Completely deranged, and the portrait it paints of our beloved country depicts a dangerous place full of neurotics and obsessives. But lots of fun, with porn, booze, backyard barbecues and elaborate revenge schemes!</snippet>

         <snippet>The best surprise is Yuan, the daughter of Hong Kong actress Cheng Pei-Pei. She has great screen presence and invests Lichi with a mix of kitty-cat cuteness and hellcat ferocity.</snippet>

         <snippet>It took gifted hucksters to make this movie, a funny and spirited - what to call it?</snippet>

         <snippet>A remarkably smart and weird film, even if it's sad and sometimes difficult to watch, with jokes designed to make you cringe.</snippet>

         <snippet>Botko and Gurland's bleak and caustic comedy gets off to a slow start and struggles to overcome the handicap of having three main characters who are, by design, highly unpleasant individuals.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result, a dissection of the complicated dynamics of sexual and economic exploitation, is pitiless and occasionally inspired.</snippet>

         <snippet>The decidedly irreverent nature of much of the proceedings will be a turnoff to some viewers, a tonic to others.</snippet>

         <snippet>The narrative manages 30 solid minutes of ingenuity, before breaking into a version of Charlie Kaufman-style absurdity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Initially amusing, ultimately wearying mock documentary.</snippet>

         <snippet>This black comedy on the making of a documentary about mail-order wives finally breaks down under the weight of its twists and turns, but mostly maintains a creepy fascination with its scuzzy characters.</snippet>
