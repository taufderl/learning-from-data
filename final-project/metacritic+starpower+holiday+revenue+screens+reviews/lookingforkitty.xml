         <snippet>Offers moments of striking insight amid the inevitable self-indulgence.</snippet>

         <snippet>A slight movie. But it has its share of charm and is a pleasant way to spend a little over an hour. It also is a sign that Burns might actually have talent.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a modest film on various levels, in terms of budget, length, cast size and technical craft. Though passable at best, the digital camerawork does aptly convey the bleakness of the cityâ€™s sidewalks and streets during winter.</snippet>

         <snippet>Burns has continued to cram one-dimensional characters into thinly plotted comedy-dramas, hoping to re-impress moviegoers with his aloof leading-man charm and faux-natural, trying-too-hard-to-be-funny dialogue.</snippet>

         <snippet>It might be the most maturely conceived role in Burns's films, but the plot around it is flimsy, the visual storytelling simpleminded, and the general ideas for character one-note. At 78 minutes, the movie says howdy, rewards little, and does not test its welcome.</snippet>

         <snippet>Burns pads around Gotham, yammering yesterday's op-eds about Disneyfication and ''classic New York holdouts.'' He somehow manages to sound fogyish AND immature.</snippet>
