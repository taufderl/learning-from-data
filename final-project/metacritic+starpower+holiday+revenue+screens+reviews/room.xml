         <snippet>For a film about looking for a sign, looking for solace, Room quite brazenly offers neither. It isn't an easy film, but the world's already got plenty of easy and easily digestible films.</snippet>

         <snippet>Winner of the John Cassavetes Award for Best Feature Under $500K at the 2006 Independent Spirit Awards, Henry's film is beautifully shot and extraordinarily well acted by Williams.</snippet>

         <snippet>The plot of the indie feature Room is, shall we say, sketchy. But that's a minor annoyance thanks to a gutsy performance by Cyndi Williams and vibrating cinematography by P.J. Raval.</snippet>

         <snippet>A perceptive, unsettling psychodrama marking the assured feature writing and directing debut of shorts filmmaker Kyle Henry.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of those rare American indies that confidently and successfully propose their own narrative logic, drawing viewers into a mental puzzle that may not contain a single clear solution.</snippet>

         <snippet>Room is an existential horror film, a parable of the war against terror being waged in Julia's psyche.</snippet>

         <snippet>Packs a punch in its first act with a passionate lead performance by Cyndi Williams and a painfully concrete sense of modern life closing in. But gradually it slips into the indie paradigm of an alienated soul rushing into darkness, climaxing with a semiabstract montage sequence that's more rhetorical than dramatic.</snippet>

         <snippet>Williams does a fine job with her role. I was pulling for her throughout her dreary journey. It's too bad it didn't get anywhere.</snippet>
