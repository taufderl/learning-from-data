         <snippet>This autobiographical tale of a 10-year-old boy coping with his mother's severe illness boasts terrific performances from its three leads -- Joe Pantoliano, Marcia Gay Harden and young Devon Gearhart.</snippet>

         <snippet>First-rate performances, an uncompromising point of view and a fresh take on a well-worn movie subject -- madness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Harden and Pantoliano (especially) can be two of the most over-the-top performers in the business, but they don't strike a false note in Canvas - and neither does this heartbreaking movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Marcia Gay Harden finds a fine balance between madness and the temptations of overacting. Yes, she runs wild sometimes, but always as a human being, not as a caricature.</snippet>

         <snippet>A movie that rings emotionally true, despite structural contrivances and dim, washed-out color.</snippet>

         <snippet>Greco's sincerity is so palpable that the frequent uplift feels deserved, but with just-passable filmmaking and the demeaning score, Canvas falls somewhere between powerful indie and made-for-TV diversion.</snippet>

         <snippet>Canvas is a thoughtful, sweet film that handles its difficult topic--schizophrenia--with tact and tenderness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Often rings painfully true, but would have benefited from judicious editing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though Harden has the showier role, a subdued Pantoliano is the movie's real star. Sometimes, the quietest performances are the most powerful.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sincere, slow-paced drama about a Florida family dealing with schizophrenia, Canvas is never terribly convincing, despite being inspired by writer-director Joseph Greco's life growing up with a mentally ill mother.</snippet>
