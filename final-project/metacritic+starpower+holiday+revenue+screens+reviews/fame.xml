         <snippet>A film that’s largely a raw, uplifting love letter to creativity in every possible form.</snippet>

         <snippet>Much of the movie has a structureless, documentary feeling to it, which is good and should have been pushed further.</snippet>

         <snippet>Since I sort of liked “Step Up 2: The Streets,” I’m not surprised I sort of liked the remake of Fame.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whether the young ensemble attains it remains to be seen. The standouts, though, are Naughton, Pennie and Perez De Tagle.</snippet>

         <snippet>It helps that Fame has been cast with performers who have the glow of possibility about them.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the movie suffers from a surfeit of flash, it nonetheless offers the undeniable power of young performers pursuing art at peak dexterity.</snippet>

         <snippet>So little time is devoted to developing characters that it's hard to share their hopes and fears.</snippet>

         <snippet>A cheesy production with underdeveloped characters that feels more like a TV pilot than a self-contained motion picture.</snippet>

         <snippet>A sad reflection of the new Hollywood, where material is sanitized and dumbed down for a hypothetical teen market that is way too sophisticated for it. It plays like a dinner theater version of the original.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's almost laughably bland and watered-down in its desire to appeal to the widest possible audience. It won't succeed in that goal, but it has enough pizzazz to captivate undemanding tweeners.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps the young performers are in such a good mood because they're liberated from having to play straight-as-a-ruler teen melodrama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fame offers slick entertainment with some exuberance, but it's devoid of soul or heart.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s not a good sign when the first few minutes of a movie about singing, dancing, rapping, video-camera-wielding teenagers reminds you of a certain grimy horror franchise.</snippet>

         <snippet>This PG-rated offering thus dances along a fine line -- one that suggests a shelf-life well short of its "I wanna live forever" anthem.</snippet>

         <snippet>The opening montage is a jazzy, grabby thing, artfully layering the kids’ auditions to mimic the frenzied pace of the day. But that freneticism never really goes away, nor does the staccato timing.</snippet>

         <snippet>The high school is so sanitized that there are no drugs, cutthroat competition, or--inconceivably for a theatrical milieu--no gay students.</snippet>

         <snippet>Someone has driven a stake through the heart and ripped out the soul of the 1980 original. The responsible parties, make that irresponsible parties, should be found, thrown in movie jail and not allowed within 50 feet of a set again. Ever.</snippet>

         <snippet>The new Fame is practically identical to Alan Parker's 1980 original -- I mean, it's the same damn movie -- except for all the parts with heart and humor and poignancy and soul and fun.</snippet>
