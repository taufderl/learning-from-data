         <snippet>In the end, this melancholy, inspiriting movie achieves a breathtaking emotional harmoniousness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Treeless Mountain is skillfully unsentimental--because of, but also despite, the presence of two irresistible, unself-conscious performers in virtually every scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is thoroughly engrossing from the opening frame to the end credits, and it’s a beautiful viewing experience.</snippet>

         <snippet>Feels both masterful and hesitant - it’s the work of a born filmmaker who’s still not quite sure what she wants to say.</snippet>

         <snippet>Both lovely and wrenching, So Yong Kim's intimate drama feels so honest, it's often difficult to watch.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's in this final chapter that the director states his message, which is handled so lightly, almost incidentally, you might miss it. But it's a profound one. For what the girls learn is that the way to get what they want -- no, need -- isn't by hoarding something, but by letting go.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kim is deft and sensitive with her tiny co-stars, but Treeless Mountain lacks the freshness and surprise of "In Between Days."</snippet>

         <snippet>Without wallowing in sentimentality or judging any of her characters, Kim has drawn a mature portrait of an elementary school girl old before her time and a loss of childhood that rings true on every level.</snippet>

         <snippet>The problem is that while the children are lovely because they are children, there is nothing inherently interesting about them or their lives.</snippet>

         <snippet>The problem with this American indie filmed in Korea is that, despite the captivating faces and sad predicament of these little girls, nothing much happens.</snippet>
