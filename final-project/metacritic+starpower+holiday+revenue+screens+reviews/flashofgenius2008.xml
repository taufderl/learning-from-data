         <snippet>It's exhilarating in an authentic, pathos-streaked way to see Kearns, through Greg Kinnear's inspired characterization of a wary obsessive, representing himself during his trial against Ford Motor Co. for stealing his design.</snippet>

         <snippet>An uncompromising and ultimately chilling look at individual creativity trampled by corporate greed, and its timing could not be more appropriate.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kearns' conflict is readable in Kinnear's every word and gesture. His performance is worth cheering.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alda gives the film's strongest performance. Kinnear, often a player of light comedy, does a convincing job of making this quiet, resolute man into a giant slayer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kinnear does what he's done in the past: You underestimate the guy's acting chops, and suddenly, strikingly, he floors you.</snippet>

         <snippet>That movie is not half bad, either. The trial, by comparison, will feel familiar to anyone who has ever watched any David take on any corporate Goliath before a court of law ("Erin Brockovich," "A Civil Action," etc., etc.).</snippet>

         <snippet>The individual components of director Marc Abraham's David-and-Goliath drama are roundly unexceptional; the script, soft and teach-y; the performances, earnest.</snippet>

         <snippet>The courtroom scenes emphasize the movie's potency as a David and Goliath saga. But the film's strength lies in its fact-based story of a wronged man turned crusader, played with vigor by Kinnear.</snippet>

         <snippet>In short, Flash of Genius fails to make viewers care with any depth about the story it's telling.</snippet>

         <snippet>The cast is excellent--especially Kinnear, who's perfected his wounded everyman persona--and Marc Abraham's direction is elegant and understated. But their work is seriously undermined by the skeletal script.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wants so much to be liked, even with its prickly, difficult hero, that it misses the mark of nonobviousness necessary not only for a patent, but also for a thrilling, original work.</snippet>

         <snippet>Maybe he was a sucker, but it was his belief in the fundamental decency of American institutions that made his struggle for redemption so winning, much more so than the movie that was made to honor it.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's also solidly constructed throughout and the acting is impeccable.  The problem is that it just lumbers along for two solid hours, never rising to any significant emotional or philosophical heights.</snippet>

         <snippet>The role is ill-suited for Kinnear's talents. Abraham's pacing is glacial, the cinematography is flat, the score by Jill Savitt is suited better to a supermarket and then there's the fact that the climax can be seen coming a mile away. Maybe the biggest, though, is its failure to play fair with the audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Kinnear is fine; he's an actor we always like, and he gives a skillful, heartfelt performance. The problem is the material -- dramatic in the describing but painfully predictable in the telling.</snippet>
