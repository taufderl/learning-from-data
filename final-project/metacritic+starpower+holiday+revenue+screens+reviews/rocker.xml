         <snippet>Wilson is pretty much the whole show. With nobody else around to steal from, he ends up stealing scenes from himself.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a lot of fun. Its spirit is genuine and, even with the odd vomit gag, fundamentally sweet.</snippet>

         <snippet>This familiar scenario works because of well-written and acted characters. The disciplined direction is by Peter Cattaneo, who tackled somewhat similar material in "The Full Monty" a decade ago.</snippet>

         <snippet>Overcomes its essential familiarity thanks to a frequently witty script, grounded direction (by Peter Cattaneo, of "Full Monty" fame) and an engaging turn by its star that proves him more than capable of carrying a comedy feature.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Rocker can be amusingly dopey, with its "Spinal Tap"-ish lampooning of rock idioms - and idiots.</snippet>

         <snippet>A grubby little redemption comedy that in every way feels like a consignment-shop Jack Black vehicle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Silly, and unashamedly second-hand, the movie is essentially a Jack Black movie without Jack Black, which is, arguably, an improvement.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Rocker has the requisite vomit, the view of some very unfortunate hind quarters and the suds. It's also got a vein of sweetness and charm.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are plenty of funny moments, as well as a sweet subplot involving the unkempt drummer and the guitarist's no-nonsense mom (Christina Applegate).</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is so tepid and inoffensive: It reminded me of a '70s Disney live-action product, with clean-scrubbed "hippies" like Johnny Whitaker chafing harmlessly under the wise ministrations of Suzanne Pleshette, whose job was to keep the kids in hand.</snippet>

         <snippet>For the most part, The Rocker is content to simply keep the beat, marking time as the summer movie season moves on.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wilson is buoyed by a sporadically witty script, and while there are no surprises whatsoever in the story, his goofy, puppylike charm renders what could have been a disaster merely an unfortunate event.</snippet>
