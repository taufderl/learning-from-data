         <snippet>From the combustible opening-credits sequence, Caan displays a whip-crack sense of timing, pace, and energy that's so rare for a first-time filmmaker that it's tempting to call him a savant.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has a relaxed poeticism to it; it's a sweetly naive, adolescent Hemingway fantasy with a star-making performance by Shawn Hatosy and good ones from everyone else (including Caan).</snippet>

         <snippet>The actor Scott Caan makes a strong debut as a writer-director in this atmospheric character study in which he also co-stars.</snippet>

         <snippet>Scott Caan, who delivers a derivative but extremely well acted drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Caan's debut film is not quite a whole thing, but it offers up enough promising fragments to make his sophomore effort worth watching for.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jeff Goldblum is a hoot as Hatosy's pot-smoking shrink, who also happens to be his mom's boyfriend, but Dallas 362 is basically a road movie that doesn't really go anywhere.</snippet>

         <snippet>Clearly, Caan's major influence is Quentin Tarantino, though he manages only a weak imitation. But give him credit for casting Kelly Lynch and Jeff Goldblum and letting them go.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a director (Caan) occasionally falls prey to the rookie mistake of excessive crosscutting, fragmenting the dramatic momentum created by his fine cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>At 100 minutes in running time, Dallas 362 can be called "The Amateur Hour-and-40-Minutes."</snippet>
