         <snippet>First-time feature director Sanaa Hamri's virtually perfect romantic comedy is a marvelous mix of brains and heart that confronts serious questions about race and dating with sensitivity, humor and enormous sex appeal.</snippet>

         <snippet>Something New delivers all the usual pleasures of a love story, and something more. The movie respects its subject and characters, and is more complex about race than we could possibly expect.</snippet>

         <snippet>It does offer that most pleasant and valuable of viewing experiences: A message movie in which story and character come first.</snippet>

         <snippet>Something New is the perfect date movie, not only because it explores a range of suitably romantic sentiments, but because it's so canny sociologically, as well as being delightfully good-natured.</snippet>

         <snippet>A satisfying chick flick that follows all the usual rules of the modern romantic comedy except one - it's not stupid.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thanks to Hamri's light touch and the considerable chemistry between Lathan and Baker, it's easy to forgive these missteps--leaving the film plenty of goodwill to spare.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kenya and Bryan are both victims of racism and also guilty of it. But the colorful mosaic of their courtship is no downer like "Crash," but rather an upbeat account of expanding social and romantic possibilities in a world where women wear the suits and men speak the language of flowers.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story's presentation is easy to take. And lot of this is because of Lathan, who is funny by not trying to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lathan, who was such a live wire as the aspiring basketballer in 2000's "Love &amp; Basketball," gives this movie an alert, glamorous presence.</snippet>

         <snippet>What sets it slightly apart is a willingness to deal with a potentially tricky subject -- race -- in the context of light-hearted fluff.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie nicely captures the area around Baldwin Hills, is crisply written by Kriss Turner and portrays the upper-middle class black community seldom seen in mainstream TV and film. However, the characterizations, even the leads, rarely rise above archetypes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wispy at best, this romantic comedy from a first-time director and screenwriter feels as if whole chunks have been left on the cutting-room floor, with what remains mustering intermittent charm thanks to the attractiveness, if not chemistry, of Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker.</snippet>

         <snippet>Something New sets out to dramatize just how little society's attitudes toward interracial relationships have changed over the past few decades, but instead ends up documenting just how little the interracial-romance message movie has evolved since the clumsy days of "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner."</snippet>

         <snippet>A shaky piece of work, with stumpy cinematography, choppy edits, speechy dialogue, and loose plotlines. And yet: There's an easygoing authenticity to the depiction of Kenya and her world that coexists with the picture's many weaknesses.</snippet>

         <snippet>The warmth of Baker as the cuddly nature boy (another idealized image, certainly, but a romantic one) and the intelligence and fire of Lathan give the lesson, and movie, just enough heart to make it enjoyable.</snippet>

         <snippet>It'll appeal to that segment of the population that goes to movies like this on Valentine's Day, but other than that, Something New feels pretty worn.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like most films of its type, Something New is not tough to sit through, but the thought of paying full price to see it isn't especially desirable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Something New never feels remotely like the world we live in - it's a fabrication of a gauzy romantic-comedy movieland where people of all colors can be equally trite and dull.</snippet>
