         <snippet>Most entertaining comic drama with a great turn by Jamie Bell.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike any coming-of-age movie you've seen before. Equal parts sweet and perverse, this Scottish film is unpredictable in places where it might be twee, and subversively fanciful in others where it might be punishing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Were it not for its pat resolutions, Mister Foe might deserve a mention alongside such classic psycho-sexual thrillers as "Vertigo" and "Peeping Tom." Instead, Mackenzie has reined in the strangeness to deliver a conventional, if better than average, mystery.</snippet>

         <snippet>The emotions are as gritty as the Edinburgh locales, and the sex is dark, urgent, and deeply selfish.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thanks mainly to Bell's abundant charisma, Hallam makes for a strangely likable antihero.</snippet>

         <snippet>May not be entirely original or entirely successful, but it's definitely fun to watch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tip-top performances, led by young British thesp Jamie Bell, and a deftly handled tone reflecting all the title teen's confused emotions make Hallam Foe a viewing delight.</snippet>

         <snippet>The whole thing's poised uneasily somewhere between urban fairy tale and actual human psychodrama, never really landing in one place or the other.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the extremity of Hallam's temperament tests the limits of our sympathy as well as our credulity, Mr. Bell's ability to seem by turns sweet and scary prevents us from losing interest entirely.</snippet>

         <snippet>This Scottish film often pushes for realism, though its stylish tones fall back on whimsy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately Mackenzie's tidy resolutions undercut the psychological depth, but as offbeat coming-of-age yarns go, Mister Foe has a commanding fleetness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mister Foe flirts too often with the unlikely and the foolish, yet there is something to admire in the nerve of its reckless characters, so uneasy in their skins.</snippet>

         <snippet>An intriguing rites-of-passage story with a delirious, skewed perspective and an almost palpable sexual pulse.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not a movie to cozy up to. The twisted tale is only mildly intriguing, worth seeing mainly for the striking performance of Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot) as Hallam Foe, a creepy teenage voyeur beset with an Oedipal complex.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film disappoints particularly in relation to "Young Adam," an earlier picture about sexual obsession from writer-director David Mackenzie; this one's more in line with the creamy tones and surface readings of "Asylum."</snippet>

         <snippet>Jamie Bell gives a watchable performance in this self-conscious, coming-of-age drama, though the film's overall effect is best described as David Lynch lite.</snippet>
