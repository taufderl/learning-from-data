         <snippet>It's a screwball comedy. It's also, I have to say, a feel-good movie that made me smile a lot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ms. Bledel works her “Gilmore Girls” charm to the hilt, but no amount of cerulean-eyed sparkle can transcend this level of thudding mediocrity.</snippet>

         <snippet>So swaddled in good intentions that it's like taking a very short journey cushioned on all sides by air bags. That are stuffed with cotton candy.</snippet>

         <snippet>After watching Post Grad, you may wonder whether Hollywood will ever stop making generic comedies with zero tolerance for originality.</snippet>

         <snippet>Post Grad isn't funny, surprising, or insightful enough to provoke more than a ho-hum reaction. It's not bad in the way that many failed comedies are bad; it's simply uninspired.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bledel brings a sweet, steady presence, but this sort of minor project is a step backwards. It's high time she graduated on to bigger and better things.</snippet>

         <snippet>Boils down, in the end, to the age-old question: Career or life? That Post Grad draws a stark line between the two, and forces its heroine into an untenable decision, might be the most disappointing thing about a movie that never quite succeeds in capturing a generation adrift.</snippet>

         <snippet>In 2009. Vicky Jenson's live-action debut is as cartoonish as her work on "Shrek," and that's OK for the comic bits. The rest seems like a remarkably cynical cross-breed—for all demographics, but, ultimately, for none.</snippet>

         <snippet>When a film whose cast includes Michael Keaton, Jane Lynch, Fred Armisen, Craig Robinson, Demetri Martin, and the now rarely seen Carol Burnett can’t scare up more than a smattering of laughs, the patient was never meant to live in the first place.</snippet>

         <snippet>Timing’s everything in comedy, so perhaps Post Grad would have seemed peppier prior to the Great Recession; circa now, this comedy feels like a cynical stroll through the unemployment lines awaiting today’s class of seniors.</snippet>
