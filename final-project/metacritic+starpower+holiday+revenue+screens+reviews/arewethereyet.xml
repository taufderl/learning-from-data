         <snippet>Cube is cute and Long is lovely, but the youngsters are too brash and smug to bear. At least there's a heartwarming end to the excursion.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is not the plot of your typical Ice Cube movie. It does, however, combine the plots of at least three John Hughes movies.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's been a while since we saw a bad John Hughes comedy, and Are We There Yet? more than fits the bill (even though Hughes had absolutely nothing to do with it).</snippet>

         <snippet>I would have loved to see a genuine love story involving Ice Cube, Nia Long, and the challenge of a lifelong bachelor dating a woman with children. Sad that a story like that couldn't get made, but this shrill "comedy" could.</snippet>

         <snippet>I can't recall ever having seen a single bad Ice Cube performance, and his utter charm even in flimsy material like this only reaffirms his gifts.</snippet>

         <snippet>All the excessive slapstick and juvenile antics keep the audience from making any kind of connection with the characters and prevents Are We There Yet? from being anything more than another disposable January release.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's all a big, boring failure of slapstick and degradation.   Of course, that's not to say your kids won't like it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Surely the only thing more excruciating than being trapped in a car with a bratty child is having to sit through a road-trip movie that features two of them.</snippet>

         <snippet>Are We There Yet? traps the affable Ice Cube in a dismal kiddy slapstick saga that even his considerable charisma can do little to enhance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gets nowhere. Its star Ice Cube remains characteristically amiable, but this thuddingly miscalculated comedy is way beneath him.</snippet>
