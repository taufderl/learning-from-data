         <snippet>Mariah Carey is perfectly fine playing a waitress who dreams of becoming, yes, a singer -- even if the superstar's presence in such a small venture seems jarring.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tennessee is drenched in melancholy, a trip through a tunnel of pain illuminated by a lone ray of light at the end.</snippet>

         <snippet>Woodleyâ€™s film mostly floats along on its melancholy drift, so well-attuned to the low-key rhythms of its beaten-down characters that it never quite summons up enough energy for the rest of us, who are along for the ride.</snippet>

         <snippet>The dramatic payoffs are either nonexistent or overly manipulated, and for a journey that starts with so much deep-set pain and regret to end with a sentimental twist feels, to use a phrase anathema in Carey's world, off-key.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately, nothing can save this pic from the warm fuzzies.</snippet>

         <snippet>The good news for Carey is that she gets to prove she's a pretty decent actress after all. The bad news, of course, is that she's done it in a movie no one has any other reason to see.</snippet>

         <snippet>It isn't saying much, but at least her (Carey) work here is more substantial than in the catastrophic "Glitter."</snippet>

         <snippet>A twist ending does nothing to make the previous 85 minutes interesting.</snippet>
