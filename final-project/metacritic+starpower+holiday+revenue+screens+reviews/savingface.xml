         <snippet>A juicy Chinese-American romance about preserving "face" at the sacrifice of your whole being. This Sony Pictures Classics release is a comic gem.</snippet>

         <snippet>A worthy addition to what must take up a whole section of the video store - the heartwarming comedy that reaffirms the power of personal choice, while also promising to love and to cherish even the most hidebound cultures.</snippet>

         <snippet>Younger viewers might be annoyed with Saving Face for not being more in-your-face progressive and edgy. Older audiences will be happy that it's not.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Despite the mysteries of the plot, a sitcom-style sense of expectation creeps into Saving Face, which sometimes feels comfortable but mostly serves to spotlight the shortcomings in a script that invents compelling characters but doesn't give them much out of the ordinary to do.</snippet>

         <snippet>A first film with a deft comedic touch and a trio of charming stars, Saving Face isn't deep - but it doesn't profess to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>What makes Alice Wu's debut so pleasurable is its easy rhythms, its sly juxtapositions, and its relaxed but funny performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>It has the heart and spirit of a true romantic comedy, and a lightness of touch that you rarely see in a debut picture.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The writer-director, Alice Wu, fudges a lot of the basics -- I never believed the heroine was really a physician -- but the final, proudly public girl-on-girl smooch still jerks a tear.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>There's almost a perverse pleasure in watching occasionally weak performers mar an essentially sound screenplay. That's the saving grace of Saving Face -- Wu gets the hard part right.</snippet>

         <snippet>Actually the problem with Saving Face as a romantic comedy is that its central romance is a drag.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is simultaneously sweet natured and sharply observed, and if love eventually conquers all, it takes its own sweet time doing it.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>In her charming debut feature, writer-director Alice Wu works hard to sidestep both pathos and antic comedy, an admirable ambition that makes for a relentlessly low-key film that nonetheless builds to a third act rich in surprising turns of character.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite a fairly explicit lesbian boobfest (projected attendance just went up!), the film is more good-natured than provocative.</snippet>
