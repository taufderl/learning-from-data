         <snippet>Immensely likable, and allows Mr. Smith to fulfill his manifest destiny -- as an urbane comedian who is also, shades of Cary Grant, a romantic hero.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hitch is 2005's lone legitimate contender for a Valentine's Day movie date.</snippet>

         <snippet>For much of its length, the premise seems less wilted than you'd guess. This is because, for one thing, Mendes gives as good as she gets.</snippet>

         <snippet>Smith turns it on with co-star Eva Mendes in a manner that will have George Clooney taking notes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Smith is an endearing, driving comedic force, one who makes the buoyant Hitch more enjoyable than it has any reason to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>The less in control Smith and his co- stars Eva Mendes and Kevin James appear, the better Hitch becomes, until it's rather delightful.</snippet>

         <snippet>Romantic comedies have become so cannibalistic lately that Hitch stands out for what seem like major innovations by comparison.</snippet>

         <snippet>But with all due respect to Smith, the movie--a performance piece with an unbelievable bare-bones plot--belongs to Kevin James.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hitch works best when it's a buddy comedy, with Smith and James having a blast as smooth Yoda and jiggly Jedi.</snippet>

         <snippet>Multiple lobotomies. That's the only way to explain what happens in the middle of Hitch, whose first hour sets up one of the brightest romantic comedies in months and whose second hour tears it down.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>James has the forward drive of a trash-compacted Ralph Kramden with some of Ed Norton's random gentility and, here at least, he has a knack for fine-tuned physical comedy that gets you laughing even when the script's not there.</snippet>

         <snippet>The premise is intriguing, and for a time it seems that the Date Doctor may indeed know things about women that most men in the movies are not allowed to know, but the third act goes on autopilot just when the Doctor should be in.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The movie's last two minutes, in which they all do goofy dances and have no dialogue or script to get in their way, is easily the highlight. It's the previous 113 minutes of plot that cause problems.</snippet>

         <snippet>Andy Tennant's flimsy but generally likeable comedy is tailor-made for Smith's cheerfully suave comic style, and the movie goes out of its way to avoid any hint of sleaziness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Will Smith, taking a break from summer sci-fi smashfests, certainly shows a gift for modulation. Far from coasting, he plays a world expert at romance by ratcheting his charm up and down in supple, exacting degrees.</snippet>

         <snippet>Along with its try-anything-for-a-yuk screenplay, the worst thing about Hitch is its running time of almost two hours. Did the studio forget to edit this flimsy thing down?</snippet>
