         <snippet>There are few cinematic crimes more heinous than making a boring action movie. Sadly, that's what the first hour of Triads-versus-Yakuza thriller War is.</snippet>

         <snippet>War is like Statham's other actioners "The Transporter" and "Crash" -- fun, but not big or dumb enough to be glorious.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a complicated plot, but one that leaves plenty of room for everything a fan could want: gunplay, swordfights, brutal mano a mano fisticuffs, motorcycle races, car chases, Japanese gangsters eating sushi off of topless women, and that old standby, a decapitated head in a box.</snippet>

         <snippet>Quickly devolves into a standard-issue crime drama laced with routine martial artistry.</snippet>

         <snippet>In spite of a late-game adrenaline surge, the hoped-for fireworks between Li and Statham never quite materialize.</snippet>

         <snippet>The action sequences are shot in close-ups and with such rapid editing, it’s nearly impossible to find a sense of rhythm let alone follow what’s happening.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lacking even the galvanizing action sequences that would have compensated for suffering through its formulaic plot, this is a thoroughly forgettable exploitationer that will not enhance its stars' resumes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Most regrettably, War squanders the considerable merits of its leads.</snippet>

         <snippet>Perhaps this movie would have been better off if it starred Steven Seagal and Tom Arnold.</snippet>

         <snippet>War ties itself in knots trying to bring something new to a stale formula. It's never painful to watch, but that's only because it provokes no feeling at all.</snippet>

         <snippet>A kind of dumbed-down, souped-up action thriller in a quasi-"Lethal Weapon" mode.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you want to see Li and Statham in an underwhelming martial arts film, rent "The One" instead. Li talks considerably more in that movie, but at least he punches a lot of people out.</snippet>

         <snippet>What is it good for? Absolutely nothing. Offering neither the enjoyably preposterous auto-heroics of the Transporter movies nor the lithe, legible athleticism of even second-tier Hong Kong thrillers.</snippet>
