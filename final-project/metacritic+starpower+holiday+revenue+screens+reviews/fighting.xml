         <snippet>Fighting has real grit and excellent acting. In other words, there is gold in that dirt.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fighting doesn’t break new ground so much as animate B-movie types, but New York movies this gritty and flavorful don't come along very often.</snippet>

         <snippet>I like the way the personalities are allowed to upstage the plot in Fighting, a routine three-act fight story that creates uncommonly interesting characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fighting is a fun, frank and faithful homage to simple inner-city drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fighting arrives fully charged by the charisma of its star, Channing Tatum, who has landed the lead in the upcoming "G.I. Joe."</snippet>

         <snippet>In a genre where too many films are all brawn and no brain, Fighting is a contender.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not "Raging Bull" or "Fight Club," but Fighting is populated by believable losers and lovingly adorned with just the right faces and peeling wallpaper to absorb you in Montiel's world.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not everything that happens in Fighting entirely makes sense -- it’s a fable, after all, and a fable doesn't necessarily have to -- but it breathes with a rough, exuberant realism that you rarely see in movies of its kind.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yet, even if the movie is a fake as a fight picture, it's still a decent commercial entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Howard's snappy-smooth performance, unsurprisingly, is what elevates Fighting from its hoary genre predecessors.</snippet>

         <snippet>As its defiantly bland title suggests, Fighting is a bare-bones effort that tries just hard enough to keep us watching. By making good use of its New York setting, Montiel does bring a certain indie grit to the generic story.</snippet>

         <snippet>In Channing Tatum, who also starred in "Saints," the film has a good-looking, magnetic hunk to draw a crowd. Terrence Howard lends the pedigree of great screen acting, and Zulay Henao adds charm and glamour.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all the utter phoniness of Fighting -- the cockeyed, faux-verite shooting, the lurches in storytelling, the lack of character development, a contrived crisis between Shawn and his would-be girlfriend Zulay and Tatum's dopey-charming thing--Fighting's not so bad.</snippet>

         <snippet>The director plays a visual game of three card monte on us for this silly, weakly acted and yet sometimes entertaining variation on the “Big Fight” movie formula.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not as if Fighting is terrible. The acting is well done, as is the unique look at the underbelly of the Big Apple.</snippet>

         <snippet>Authentic locations and careful attention to detail help evoke several New York boroughs in all their gritty vitality, but the screenplay about a hunky street vendor turned underground fighter is sloppy and false.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie never works up a pulpy head of steam. It's like an exploitation movie that thinks it's an art movie, only there's no art to be found.</snippet>
