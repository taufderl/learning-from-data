         <snippet>It's a family film that deals with real problems and teaches real values, and yet is exciting and entertaining.</snippet>

         <snippet>Saving Shiloh is like one of those wholesome, old-fashioned films that you used to watch with your third-grade classmates during visits to the library.</snippet>

         <snippet>An honorable, squeaky-clean children's drama, this is notable for its relatively penetrating morality and for Scott Wilson's fine performance as the meanest man in town.</snippet>

         <snippet>May be naive and narratively simple, but it's prime fare for the always underserved family audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>Touching, intelligent and admirably thoughtful, but more action-packed than its predecessors, thanks to escaped convicts, a local murder and a truly suspenseful finale, with lives at stake.</snippet>

         <snippet>Solid family fare. Like its source material, the Missouri-shot Saving Shiloh is down-home country without condescending to hicks from the sticks.</snippet>

         <snippet>Saving Shiloh takes place in 2005, but in its setting and sensibility, it feels like 1930s Walton's Mountain.</snippet>

         <snippet>Based on the last book in Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's award-winning trilogy, this third installment in the family-friendly "Shiloh" series is perfect for anyone who wishes "The Waltons" was still around.</snippet>

         <snippet>Offers exactly what you've come to expect from the series: Bland but wholly innocuous family entertainment featuring a cute kid and an even cuter dog.</snippet>
