         <snippet>Isn't for the kiddies. It probably isn't for anyone not interested in the darkest corners of the human psyche.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ma Mere, with its sun-drenched sense of dread and band of reckless, unlikable characters, isn't very good, but that doesn't stop the actors -- especially the intrepid Huppert -- from going all the way.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's pretentious highbrow trash, but as far as that goes it works pretty well.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Christophe Honore's respectable, tightly coiled, but ultimately unrewarding adaptation of Georges Bataille's posthumous novel.</snippet>

         <snippet>Based on a novel by French provocateur Georges Bataille, an important thinker whose fiction rarely translates into good cinema.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all its shocking content, it remains a rather conventional psychological portrait of Oedipal attraction taken to a disturbing extreme.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ma Mère, while less prudish than Catherine Breillat's dour deconstructions of sex, is also less competent. It winds up making incest look absurdly swank.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yet another stylish exercise in depravity in which Huppert floats through the sordid proceedings in a calm haze. If only the film she inhabits was as sexy as it aspires to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>At first, Ma Mère is shocking and even alluring, but it doesn't take long for the conceit to wear thin, especially since the characters so rarely act as recognizable humans.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ma Mère may be ludicrous, but its cast displays a commitment that deserves more than grudging admiration.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you are at all squeamish about incest and/or prefer sex scenes without violent undertones, you should avoid this movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>This tale of disaffected sexual depravity is practically a parody of the worst of French filmmaking.</snippet>

         <snippet>Honoré never gets beneath these characters' sunburned skins, and well before the end, the film tips irretrievably over into the realm of absurdity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Huppert is wonderful, as usual, and she's to be congratulated for taking this daring role. But, alas, even she can't save Ma Mere.</snippet>

         <snippet>110 minutes of Euro silliness mitigated only by the presence of Huppert and the striking ability of the actors to keep a straight face throughout this mess.</snippet>
