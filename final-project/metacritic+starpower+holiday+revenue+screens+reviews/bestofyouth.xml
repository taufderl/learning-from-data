         <snippet>This is epic filmmaking on a profoundly human scale, directed to perfection and magnificently acted by everyone in sight.</snippet>

         <snippet>Smart, generous, as subtle as it is expansive, this is storytelling of a rare order. Six hours may seem like a big investment, but the emotional pay-back is beyond price.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like a great novel from a more expansive bygone age, The Best of Youth is full of big thoughts; like a great soap opera, it's also full of sharp plot turns, vibrant characters, and great talk. It is, in short, the best of cinema.</snippet>

         <snippet>So in-depth, so appealing, so easy to sit through and so anomalously grand scale that few who see it will ever forget it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story unfolds at such length and over so many years that politics tend to fade into the wallpaper, leaving an exceptionally rich family story.</snippet>

         <snippet>And like all great family sagas, The Best of Youth, while tipping its hat to the painful confusion of living life forward, reels it backward to give it the thrilling significance of time and place.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Best of Youth doesn't have a boring millisecond. It isn't an art film, with longueurs; it's a mini-series with the sweep of a classic novel, with tons of plot.</snippet>

         <snippet>At nearly six hours, pic's extreme length lets Giordana and screenwriters Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli build up a novelistic rhythm, pulling the audience so deeply and forcefully into their story that it becomes like a enveloping dream; when it's over, parting with the characters is truly sweet and sorrowful.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eminently watchable, The Best of Youth nonetheless lacks the devastating emotional gut punch of its obvious inspiration, Visconti's "Rocco and His Brothers."</snippet>
