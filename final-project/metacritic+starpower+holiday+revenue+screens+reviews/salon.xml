         <snippet>Though rooted in broad stereotypes and sassy platitudes, the film's feisty cast and generally sunny outlook make for warm and reassuring comfort viewing, the equivalent of a straight-from-the-box dish of mac and cheese.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite all the stock characters and scenarios, Fox and company manage to bring things to life. And cut some hair.</snippet>

         <snippet>Adapted from a years-old stage play, The Salon, Mark Brown's stilted, sista-centric answer to "Barbershop," definitely shows its roots. And despite a few highlights, the overall effect is not pretty.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie includes a few good one-liners, but that's really all it is -- a forum for putdowns and sassy dialogues.</snippet>

         <snippet>The main problem with the movie is the by now shopworn nature of its setting. Been there, snipped it. Though dating from venerable material, The Salon turns out to be one haircut too many.</snippet>

         <snippet>A romance between Fox and the attorney trying to force her out (Darrin Henson) taxes belief and leads to a sappy ending that doesn't come soon enough.</snippet>

         <snippet>A tiresome blend of overacting and underwriting, The Salon moves from one predictable conversation to another -- the lack of available black men, the wondrousness of Bill Clinton -- without originality or comic rhythm.</snippet>

         <snippet>It isn't as if any of the actors do an especially bad job or anything – Fox is capable enough as the lead, and Whitley and Wilson especially carry themselves quite well – but you can't help asking yourself, what's the point? Are there that many more broad topics in need of shallow examination by a Hollywood studio picture?</snippet>
