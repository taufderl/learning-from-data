         <snippet>Cloudy is smart, insightful on a host of relationship dynamics, and filled with fast-paced action.</snippet>

         <snippet>Wise and respectful of its audience, "Cloudy" thus never stops the fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>The sights are ingenious, impressively rendered in 3-D, and the sounds – including cheeky voice work by Mr. T, Neil Patrick Harris, and Benjamin Bratt – are a blast.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film combines a pinch of morality with a healthy dose of humor to produce a movie that's entertaining for everyone.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s a brisk, bright, winning effort, even though it already looks sadly out of touch with the times.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ends with a big action sequence, turning into Raiders of the Lost Arby's when you wish it would serve up something less conventional. But by that time, the filmmakers have also served up a little food for thought, along with a lot of laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>A surprisingly savory treat, though it doesn't bear much resemblance to the charming classic children's book on which it's based.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's humor targets both kids and grown-ups with equal success, but, even with the presence of a mustache-fixated monkey, the main attraction here is the movie's vibrant 3-D animation and its perfect storm of foodie-friendly sight gags.</snippet>

         <snippet>The splashy animation is well-executed but again a bit monotonous for a full-length feature.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eye-popping and mouth-watering in one, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs spins a 30-page children's book into a 90-minute all-you-can-laugh buffet.</snippet>

         <snippet>Goes down easy enough at first. But even at a svelte 81 minutes, this meal drags on too long.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is clear definition between closer and further elements. I've seen a lot of 3-D recently, and in terms of technical quality, this is the best.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the filmmakers opt to make only light statements about junk food, obesity and solid waste, they at least leave the audience sated on a single serving of inspired lunacy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Leaves us with is sporadic showers of laughs for kids under 10. That's a shame, because the film could have been a delight for everyone, if only it hadn't learned to behave.</snippet>
