         <snippet>It honors the tone of that wonderful comedy while setting it in present-day New York City.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's story actually does work as a story and not simply as a wheezy Hollywood formula. Sometimes you walk into a movie with quiet dread and walk out with quiet delight.</snippet>

         <snippet>This harmless but mediocre enterprise was doomed to failure from the start. Hollywood magic can do a lot, but it can't raise the dead.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plays a bit better than it sounds. I miss the show's mangy, minimalist sets, but the slapdash narrative construction and good-hearted schmaltz survive intact.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Honeymooners isn't the worst of the endless spate of TV rehashes, but it still feels perfunctory.</snippet>

         <snippet>Epps has a nicely beaten charm to him -- among the leads, he alone looks like he knows what a trip to the moon costs.</snippet>

         <snippet>No less amusing than an average sitcom, but that's certainly not reason enough to buy a ticket.</snippet>

         <snippet>At least The Honeymooners is not one of those remakes that looks bad compared to the original. It's just bad, period.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cedric is certainly the bright spot in this movie - personable, silly and lovable, with just enough of Gleason's girth, timing and humanity to make you wish he'd driven Ralph Kramden's bus onto the lot of a different movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>John Schultz's wan, unfunny The Honeymooners is unlikely to tickle devotees of Jackie Gleason's archetypal yuk-fest.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though Cedric, for all his nimble portliness, is no Gleason, there's plenty of talent to be found here. Too bad it's left to fend for itself against a raging mechanical bull of a script.</snippet>

         <snippet>The filmmakers have also advertised that their new movie eliminates the "Pow! Right in the kisser!" threats of spousal abuse that permeated the original series. The question of audience abuse has yet to be addressed.</snippet>

         <snippet>A pitiful update that saddles poor Cedric the Entertainer with the unenviable task of taking over Jackie Gleason's premier creation, Ralph Kramden.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s a shame when a movie brings together so many underutilized thespians of color – even Ajay Naidu of "Office Space" is in here someplace – and gives them absolutely nothing to do.</snippet>
