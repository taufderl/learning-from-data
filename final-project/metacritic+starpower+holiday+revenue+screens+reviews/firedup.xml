         <snippet>The teensploitation premise is like something a porn filmmaker from the '70s might have come up with. But Fired Up! has one added quirk: The script, credited to Freedom Jones, is a riot of tongue-twisting ironic sleaze -- it sounds like the first (and last) collaboration between Diablo Cody and Artie Lange.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s surprisingly funny for another weak "American Pie" rip-off; Nicholas D'Agosto and Eric Christian Olsen make a hilarious pair; If you're under the age of 25 you’ll like it.</snippet>

         <snippet>A kind of dumb but also kind of smart-about-being-dumb comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie has a sharper and more acerbic screenplay than you normally find in bargain-basement, D-list teen comedies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Passable in its efficiency, Fired Up! is less offensive than it might have been while also managing to be staggeringly uninspired.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though not nearly as raucously funny as the leads in "Wedding Crashers," Nick and Shawn resemble junior versions of the one-track-minded womanizers played by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you loved "Wedding Crashers," then, for all intents and purposes, you've already seen Fired Up – because this new movie borrows from the 2005 Vince Vaughn/Owen Wilson hit with such utter shamelessness, you have to wonder if royalty checks are already in the mail.</snippet>
