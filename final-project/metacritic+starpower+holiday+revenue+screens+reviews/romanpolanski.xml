         <snippet>This is a superb picture, sharp, open-minded, wised-up and cinematically accomplished.</snippet>

         <snippet>As an anatomy not only of Polanski's psyche but also of the legal system he confronted, it's as baroquely compelling as "The Dark Knight."</snippet>

         <snippet>A mesmerizing portrait of the director as acclaimed artist and tortured human being.</snippet>

         <snippet>The most significant fact of the film is that the prosecutor Gunson, a straight-laced Mormon, agrees with the defender Dalton that justice was not served.</snippet>

         <snippet>Falls short of being a great film because it lacks a certain ambition.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its one-week theatrical run will make it eligible for Academy Award consideration, though given that organization's often pitiful record when it comes to nonfiction film, it seems unlikely that a movie this subtly intelligent would make its short list.</snippet>

         <snippet>It was a true media circus, and despite Polanski's work before and since, the film shows how it will forever be his first association in the public consciousness. In the U.S., at least.</snippet>

         <snippet>I wish Zenovich wasn't forced to skate surfaces when it comes to Polanski's perspective -- his interviews are vague and archival -- but she skillfully works around him to craft a maddening look at one of Hollywood's most infamous trials.</snippet>

         <snippet>The phrase in the title "wanted and desired" is offered by a producer friend of Polanski's who describes him as "wanted" in the United States, but "desired" in Europe, where sexual behaviour is treated more honestly and artists' dark sides are celebrated.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film walks a fine line between contempt for Polanski's crimes and sympathy for his trials and his screwed-up psyche, and it manages both while showing us why he fled the U.S. rather than face the corrupted judicial circus.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is most remarkable when it exposes the ease with which the press and a self-obsessed judge can pervert the country's justice system.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you go into "Wanted and Desired" with preconceptions, prepare to feel them challenged and altered, even if they are ultimately confirmed. The facts speak loudly.</snippet>

         <snippet>With a subject like Roman Polanski, you don't really need to do much to capture audience interest. But maybe that's the reason Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired doesn't live up to its promise.</snippet>
