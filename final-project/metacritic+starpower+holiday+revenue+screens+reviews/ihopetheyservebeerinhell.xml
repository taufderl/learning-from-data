         <snippet>The film is consistently fun, and Tucker's comeuppance &#8232; will leave you gasping (if not gagging) with laughter.</snippet>

         <snippet>The idea is that the guys' adventure proves transformative, but Tucker's dramatic I've-seen-the-light speech is charged with just the right degree of glibness to leave one skeptical.</snippet>

         <snippet>Distinguishes itself from such last-fling-before-the-wedding comedies as "The Hangover" with the grittiness of its Texas locales and the smug intelligence of its unapologetically narcissistic protagonist.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tucker Max’s only real strengths are his outrageousness and his uncompromising self-confidence, but neither comes into play in this punch-pulling, frankly boring film.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mediocre gross-out movie that barely pushes the envelope.</snippet>

         <snippet>Slightly better than it should be. For Tucker Max, this possibly represents a triumph.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not a total wipeout: Czuchry embodies the Tucker Max(-ims) to a self-obsessed fault, and there are moments of rough comic brilliance scattered throughout, but really, this particular antihero is all anti- and zero hero.</snippet>

         <snippet>This unfunny, über-misogynistic adaptation of Tucker Max's audacious best-seller of the same name is unlikely to please anyone.</snippet>

         <snippet>If Max and his "Hell" collaborators feel stymied by the summer hit "The Hangover," they'd be justified to scream to the bromance gods that someone stole their film's concept. But those guys did it the right way, bro.</snippet>

         <snippet>Visually incompetent to a painful extreme and almost never funny, but, worst of all, it doesn't have the courage of Max's unadulterated convictions. If you're going to offend the easily offended, at least go big.</snippet>

         <snippet>Achieves a certain cinematic distinction by outdoing "Dumb and Dumber" in sheer grossness and detail with its depiction of the unfortunate effects of explosive diarrhea.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result just might be the most hypocritical feature in the history of film as well as the history of hypocrisy, and along with serving beer, I hope they show I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell in hell.</snippet>

         <snippet>This desperate effort by ­professional frat boy Tucker Max may be the most dismal movie of the decade.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just when you thought this movie had run out of bad ideas, this last-minute outpouring of sanctimony feels like a whole new way of being slimed. Some movies come with parental warnings; this one feels as though it should come with a mandatory biohazard suit.</snippet>
