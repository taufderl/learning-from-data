         <snippet>The spare, enjoyable Naked Fame, by the documentarian Chris Long, suggests that today's pornography performers enjoy better life options than those revisited in "Inside Deep Throat."</snippet>

         <snippet>What makes the film more interesting than it might have been, however, is the warm relationship between Glenn and Peter.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sub-par video camerawork and editing make the film a trying and tedious experience, despite the engaging personality and impressive physicality of its star.</snippet>

         <snippet>Scenes in which Ford meets with record-industry honchos and a manipulative producer suggest that the music business is almost as exploitative as the porn business.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's interesting in the same way the early, rejection episodes of "American Idol" are oddly compelling. But, of course, you can watch those for free.</snippet>
