         <snippet>Surprise, surprise. X-Men: The Last Stand, the third big-screen convocation of mutant shape shifters, weather changers, ice makers, energy suckers, healers and telepaths from Marvel Comics, has shifted the shape of the franchise from pretty good, if uninspired, to terrifically entertaining.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ratner is unable to maintain the emotional intensity that has made this series so deeply epic. But he sure knows how to put on a show.</snippet>

         <snippet>Love it or hate it, X-III packs more action and razzle-dazzle visuals into its 104-minute running time than "Mission: Impossible III," "Poseidon" and "The Da Vinci Code" combined.</snippet>

         <snippet>The happiest news about the third (and final?) X-Men movie is actually quite sad: headstones. Yes, The Last Stand brings the lamentable deaths of several major characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>I liked the action, I liked the absurdity, I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I especially liked the way it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight it out with the special effects.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though the picture is not without its wow-inducing, SFX-driven moments, that potent X-factor is considerably diminished in Singer's absence.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a fast and enjoyable B-movie, though, and Hugh Jackmanâ€™s Wolverine brings some good stormy drama to the proceedings.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result, though it delivers only in fits and starts, is still sharper and more inventive than most comicbook-adapted fare, and eventually gets the job done as far as action buffs are concerned.</snippet>

         <snippet>If little else, the third and supposedly final entry in the  X-Men mega-franchise suggests that some movies -- or at any rate some formulas -- are not just critic-proof, they might even be director-proof.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ratner seems to have found a theme that he can relate to: A terrifying trio of angry, undomesticated women who all but run away with the movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is interesting stuff. So why does The Last Stand feel driven to dumb itself down, as if embarrassed by its own ideas?</snippet>

         <snippet>I suppose it's asking too much of Ratner to impart some kind of visionary flourish to the proceedings. But without it, these comic-book movies all tend to look the same.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Has a couple of emotionally resonant scenes that build on the first two story lines. But it lacks the intriguing moody quality of the previous films. The mutants are more pumped up and angry this time, rather than misunderstood and conflicted.</snippet>

         <snippet>Disappointingly, X-Men: The Last Stand slides back between the first two episodes. It's not stuporous, and it's not super.</snippet>

         <snippet>With more superheroes, more action and more stuff blowing up than ever before, X-Men: The Last Stand has the climactic oomph that suggests a finale, though not the gravitas to suggest a resolution.</snippet>

         <snippet>Comic-book enthusiasts can breathe a sigh of relief: Brett Ratner hasn't completely ruined the X-Men series a.k.a. "The Franchise that Bryan Singer Built."</snippet>

         <snippet>While I didn't love it, I enjoyed The Last Stand because it made me imagine the mutant powers I want to develop. I'm thinking along the lines of merging Rogue's suction abilities with Storm's controlled-rain skills.</snippet>

         <snippet>Singer's absence is felt but not fatal. By adding too much new blood Ratner loses some of the original DNA, but with its nifty set-pieces and a few nasty surprises, X3's still a worthy enough sequel to ensure itâ€™s no Last Stand.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's much to enjoy here â€“ Ratner's pacing is fluid and fast and the film rushes along its busy, cluttered way with something approaching melodramatic snarkiness â€“ but it's also terribly busy and cluttered.</snippet>
