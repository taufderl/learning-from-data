         <snippet>The film avoids theorizing about why the bridge should exert such a hold over the imaginations of suicides all over the world, but Steel's dramatic cinematography, particularly the distorted telephoto shots that make the bridge loom even larger than it already does in life, provide one answer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Both a beautiful film and a disturbing one, and the connection between those two characteristics makes it the most disquieting of documentaries.</snippet>

         <snippet>A serious, wrenching and oddly poetic documentary.</snippet>

         <snippet>The real item under consideration here is the movie itself, and the bottom line is that it lands in a humane place. True, any viewer will go in with a certain curiosity, ghoulish or otherwise, about what it's like to jump off a bridge, and yet the overall effect of the film is broadening. To see it is to dread the bridge jumps and to come away with a feeling of compassion and empathy.</snippet>

         <snippet>While these interviews are affecting, and the movie talks about suicide in a refreshingly straightforward manner, it's the images of these actual deaths that induce horrified gasps.</snippet>

         <snippet>You leave The Bridge with a new appreciation for your (relative) mental stability and a vow to make the most of your brief, ephemeral life.</snippet>

         <snippet>I still have unanswered moral questions about the film -- unanswered because unanswerable, I suspect -- but it's a beautiful, wrenching, horrifying work of cinema, unlike anything I have ever seen or will see again.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Bridge packs a visceral emotional wallop. How could it not? But along with plenty of difficult questions, Steel's film leaves a sour, disturbing aftertaste.</snippet>

         <snippet>The results are striking: an emotional and aesthetic whirlpool of horror, fascination, beauty (it's hard not to feel a bit guilty â€“ even morbid - enjoying such beauty), and resignation that would probably drown lesser movies but that gives The Bridge an eerie power.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is an attractive, well-intentioned film that is surprisingly dull and uninvolving.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a new form of obscenity that might be called suicide porn. It's not just the voyeuristic surveillance that's obscene, but the use of suicide footage as counterpoint to other stories as they're told. Steel shows no special insight into the subject, though even that couldn't justify such hideousness.</snippet>
