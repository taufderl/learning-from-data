         <snippet>Features more than enough thrilling wirework, slow and agonizing deaths, and blood-spattered faces to please even the most discriminating fans of the genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a moody drama, it falls short, but as lightweight escapism, it sets off sporadic but irresistible explosions of pure cinematic delight.</snippet>

         <snippet>A movie of such cheerful craziness and nonstop ferocity that you can't take it seriously for a second.</snippet>

         <snippet>The tone is bleak and the comic-book violence relentless, but the wirework and Yuta Morokaji's stunt choreography are impressive, culminating in a breathless showdown between the title character (Aya Ueto) and 200 foes.</snippet>

         <snippet>A little boring and extremely long for what it is, all that Azumi really has going for it are several eye-popping battle sequences, including the climax which is a totally delicious celebration of graphic violence, and some nice camera work.</snippet>

         <snippet>Inevitable comparisons to Quentin Tarentino's femme-centered carnage extravaganza "Kill Bill" are not unwarranted insofar as both films featurefeature an abstract, self-conscious, and decidedly post-modern approach to a moribund genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a bad idea to get too fond of any character, no matter how worthy he (or she) may appear.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, the film itself -- though it contains some superbly staged and highly lavish action sequences -- lacks the tautness of its heroine.</snippet>

         <snippet>An uneven effort overall that when it is working has a strange, engaging energy that is often overturned by an uncertain staidness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Failing in its attempts at Zhang Yimouâ€“like poetry, Azumi calls to mind a long, blood-splattered director's cut of a Power Rangers episode.</snippet>

         <snippet>The director, Ryuhei Kitamura, whose earlier films include the cult film "Versus," brings nothing new to the samurai-swordsman game other than some styling shorts for the whelps and a miniskirt for Azumi.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story is superficial at best. And the movie is too long.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you're considering the scenario via Japan's ubiquitous pedo-porn tendencies, you're too educated for this exhaustive, manga-based bloodbath, which trails after these angsty teenyboppers on a scorched-fake-earth path through hundreds of growling baddies of every genre size and type.</snippet>
