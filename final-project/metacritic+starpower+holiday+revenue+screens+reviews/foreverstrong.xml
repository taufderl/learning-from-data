         <snippet>There's something disheartening about seeing real-life stories and their inevitable complexities put through the Hollywood sausage machine and transformed into bland parables about a privileged, wayward young bucks redeemed by wise, infinitely patient mentors and the self-abnegating spirit of team sports.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite all the macho posturing, the corny story is just as sappy as anything on Lifetime.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though director Ryan Little puts together a clean, professional package, at bottom this is a nearly-two-hour scrum of therapeutic direct encounters.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is well shot and edited, the rugby scenes are enjoyable (if likely puzzling to the uninitiated) and "Strong's" earnestness excuses at least some of its predictability.</snippet>

         <snippet>This inspirational sports drama unfolds in such generic fashion that it feels contrived more often than it rings true.</snippet>

         <snippet>The performances are credible across the board, excessive sentimentality is largely avoided, and the sequences devoted to rough-and-tumble rugby match-ups are expertly shot and edited.</snippet>

         <snippet>Forever Strong is generic faith-and-redemption fare, devoid of nuance.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mawkish drama hobbled by a thoroughly unpleasant and uncharismatic lead performance.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the script serves any purpose at all, it is to allow jocks to show off their buff bodies. They're hot, but not worth 12 bucks at the box office.</snippet>
