         <snippet>Cera once again does his "Michael Cera thing." Personally, I love his "thing" but know it’s not for everyone, and I agree that it doesn’t always work contextually. But trust me, here it really works.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's hide-and-seek attitude toward truth mirrors the intricacies of one lover getting to know another -- an arresting notion of the heart that's much more than paper-deep.</snippet>

         <snippet>A quasi-documentary about love that is sweet, true and perhaps a little deceptive.</snippet>

         <snippet>Enjoying this wondrous wisp of a something is easy, describing it is hard. Luckily, Charlyne Yi is an enchantress.</snippet>

         <snippet>Doesn't always have a clear path, but that is part of its meandering appeal. It asks if true love exists, then renders it a rhetorical question.</snippet>

         <snippet>At best, they entertain in a "people say the darndest things" kind of way. But they do support the notion that people still fall in love and find a way to make it work for a lifetime, which is about as happy an ending as you could wish for.</snippet>

         <snippet>Paper Heart isn't the most cloying instance of earnest indie quirk to emerge in the past few months, nor is it the most charming, but the mere fact that such a continuum exists is reason enough to worry.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's all kind of silly and amorphous, but the scenes between Yi and Cera, whether or not they were scripted, have a babes-in-the-wood loveliness.</snippet>

         <snippet>This movie may be sickly sweet, but it's harmless; and as a handcrafted antidote to a toxic toy story like "G.I.Joe," Paper Heart has healing properties.</snippet>

         <snippet>A "hybrid documentary" that bemusedly blurs the line between fact and fiction.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Cera is adorable, Yi’s faux ­naiveté is overplayed and her philosophical musings are underwhelming. But you won’t soon forget the real-life couples she interviews.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>At times, the relentless preciousness, the ironic distance, the posture of "We're just adorably like this" gets to be a little too much.</snippet>

         <snippet>The end product feels trite and unfinished, with the romantic plot being awkwardly and unconvincingly shoehorned into a production that lacks focus.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>It's a neat, sweet experiment in meta-documentary filmmaking overall, but like Yi's own heart, it sabotages itself in the process and becomes another casualty of too-close scrutiny.</snippet>

         <snippet>There may be a fairly sharp line dividing those who find the whole delightfully odd, and those irked by what could be read as a faux childlike simplicity to the enterprise.</snippet>

         <snippet>A documentary except when it's a mockumentary, this is all kinds of adorable and heartbreaking--the doc part, at least.</snippet>

         <snippet>This breach with the audience does matter, for it is one thing to seduce your viewers and quite another to trick them. Love is all about trust, after all.</snippet>

         <snippet>Your enjoyment of Paper Heart will hinge almost entirely on your receptiveness to Ms. Yi and the extreme iteration of social awkwardness she represents.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yi's self-regarding, ironic tone makes the whole thing feel like a setup, designed more as an indie-chic calling card than a sincere inquiry.</snippet>
