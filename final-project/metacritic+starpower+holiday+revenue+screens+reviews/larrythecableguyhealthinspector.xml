         <snippet>As an expat redneck, I recognize the deep, dumb need of every group for its own culturally customized minstrel show. Larry, a junker ''star'' vehicle run on arse wind and fan love, fills that niche.</snippet>

         <snippet>Entirely comfortable as the crude character he has honed in countless stand-up routines and TV appearances, Larry the Cable Guy sustains a level of likeability that enables him to get away with a lot more than he has any right to. But, he remains very much an acquired taste.</snippet>

         <snippet>Folks watching any movie that opens with a shot of a butt crack (with the possible exception of "Lost in Translation") can't claim they weren't warned.</snippet>

         <snippet>Larry offers enough scatological humor to fertilize the wheat fields in the star's home state of Nebraska.</snippet>

         <snippet>Toilet humor, jokes about paraplegics and serious overacting make this lowbrow comedy an irritating watch.</snippet>

         <snippet>You have to be a bit of an arrested adolescent to think "Larry" is funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though some of his one-liners are pretty good, his shtick can't sustain this dutifully scripted comedy. Megyn Price, who's done time on the sitcom Grounded for Life, is a welcome distraction as the waitress with a crush on Larry.</snippet>

         <snippet>Laughing at this turkey might not necessarily make you a redneck, but it sure does make you easily amused.</snippet>

         <snippet>''Health Inspector" hopes to do for Larry what ''Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" did for Jim Carrey, who in this context looks like Noel Coward.</snippet>

         <snippet>This so-called comedy is so not funny, it makes "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo" look like Chaplin.</snippet>
