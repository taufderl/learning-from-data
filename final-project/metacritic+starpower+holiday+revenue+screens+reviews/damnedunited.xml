         <snippet>It's a classic and even charming yarn of vanity, hubris and redemption, played out against the bizarre, intense alternate universe of '70s English soccer.</snippet>

         <snippet>The rare sports movie that deals with -- indeed positively relishes -- humiliation and disappointment.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's barely any on-field footage in The Damned United. What we get instead is fine acting and directing, splendid dialogue and a story too outrageous to be made up.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's more than a detailed account of one man's petty vindictiveness in a bygone era. It's about how our hatred can consume us so deeply that we lose sight of everything.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s a fascinating story about ambition and vanity and pride, and in Sheen’s performance and the atmosphere capture by Hooper it contains truly fine and rare things.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sheen is startlingly good here, and so is Timothy Spall as Clough's trusted and much abused lieutenant.</snippet>

         <snippet>What's lost in translation is recovered easily enough in Michael Sheen's astonishing performance as Clough.</snippet>

         <snippet>A movie about soccer that doesn't spend a lot of time on the field, The Damned United, like everything Morgan writes, is an intimate character study, one that is enriched by a stellar ensemble of British pros, including Jim Broadbent as Derby's team owner.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hardly the heady stuff of "Frost/Nixon"--or then again, maybe exactly the same thing. This one’s more rude and fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately it's Sheen, finding new facets of his character in every scene, who shoots and scores.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>A dramedy laying out the dueling coaching philosophies of guys who doubtless meant a great deal to fans, but of whom I'd been blissfully unaware for decades -- is enormously engaging.  Enormously.</snippet>

         <snippet>Two things that the British know that most Americans don't: Michael Sheen is the best actor in the English-speaking world; and soccer is the only football that matters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hooper, the director, doesn’t include lots of amazing football sequences to upstage his star. He just moves everyone out of Sheen’s way. It’s about time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Tom Hooper ("John Adams") ably balances the games (surprisingly little football footage, actually), the personalities and the drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Telling with a light, surefooted touch a legendary tale from British soccer history, The Damned United reps the latest collaboration in factual fiction between chameleon thesp Michael Sheen, screenwriter Peter Morgan and producer Andy Harries ("Frost/Nixon," "The Queen").</snippet>

         <snippet>Michael Sheen, who adds to his gallery of public figures (Tony Blair, David Frost) with a sharp performance here as the legendary UK soccer coach Brian Clough.</snippet>

         <snippet>Meaney’s Flintstone-ian brute makes a terrific foil to Sheen’s prissy arrogance, but the other supporting players don’t make much of an impression. Ditto for this slice of history itself, though mileage may vary for soccer fans.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like a skill player who just can't score, The Damned United is all dazzle and no finish and, ultimately, damned frustrating.</snippet>
