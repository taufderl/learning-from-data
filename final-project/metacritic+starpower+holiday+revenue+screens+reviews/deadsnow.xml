         <snippet>Cheery, silly, splattery, and respectful of its elders (and betters, particularly Sam Raimi's "The Evil Dead").</snippet>

         <snippet>Wirkola keeps the narrative taut, wasting not a frame; and he throws in funny moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>May have a dull title, but it's lively, idiotic fun, at least until it goes too far past "too far" into the realm of "far too far."</snippet>

         <snippet>Any horror movie with the moxie to play Tchaikovsky's "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" during a zombie attack can't be all bad.</snippet>

         <snippet>The pic reveals itself as a horror-action-comedy a la "Evil Dead," with amusing twists of fate and over-the-top gore.</snippet>

         <snippet>The concept doesn't go much further than the wardrobe department--that is, until a deliriously over-the-top climax finally rouses the film from its "Evil Dead"-mimicking stupor.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you tamp down your expectations -- those gaping plot holes are dangerous! -- there is a storm of scary fun to be had in this Scandinavian splatterfest.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dead Snow, as you may have gathered, is a comedy, but played absolutely seriously by sincere, earnest young actors.</snippet>

         <snippet>As is often the case with movies of this type, the real stars are the special-effects team, which does some admirably disgusting work.</snippet>

         <snippet>For more than half of this 90-minute film, director Tommy Wirkola plays things pretty straight--a mistake, perhaps, since the first half is pretty boring--but once the Nazi zombies start arriving en masse, he abruptly shifts to an "Evil Dead"â€“style zaniness, including the sight of a potential victim hanging off the side of a mountain while using a zombie's entrails as rope.</snippet>

         <snippet>This Norwegian zombie flick is perfect for those who just want a few good jolts and whole lot of gore.</snippet>

         <snippet>So Dead Snow fulfills one zombie-movie prerequisite. It's different.</snippet>

         <snippet>This blood-soaked melodrama -- a far cry from most foreign films -- has been a festival favorite and might well develop a cult following, though it's far too gory to reach beyond the core audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>This splatter film is set in Norway, but rest assured, it sticks with the formula. The young people to be killed off are just as obnoxious as their counterparts in American gorefests.</snippet>

         <snippet>Combining the undead and the Third Reich seems like a novel idea--the peanut butter and jelly of trash culture--but in fact Spanish exploitation legend Jesus Franco already got to it back in 1981 with "Oasis of the Zombies."</snippet>
