         <snippet>More love story than thriller, with the mystery providing only slack tension and the December-December romance that ultimately develops between Regina and Camargo crackling with drama and sexual tension aplenty.</snippet>

         <snippet>Montenegro's character has a spark in her eye, and a determination, that makes this quiet, intelligent film anything but boring.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a rare combination of romance and sly social commentary, delivered with a raw emotional punch.</snippet>

         <snippet>An absorbing new spin on the ingenious "Rear Window" concept, with poignant comments on aging in modern society.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mystery that isn't suspenseful so much as realistic, in which the detective's motivation is understandable and the story moves the way life does, instead of as a thrill ride.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bernstein blunts the inherent tension by zipping everything along at the pace of a snail with a sore foot. Still, Montenegro does wonders in her long silences, and makes her love scene with the eager 72-year-old Cortez look like a hookup at Club Med.</snippet>

         <snippet>Montenegro's performance is typically multifaceted, displaying keen wit and a thick streak of self-doubt.</snippet>

         <snippet>Writer-director Marcos Bernstein is more interested in how a melodramatic imagination can distort reality, a concept he explores with charm and tact.</snippet>

         <snippet>A diverting blend of "Rear Window"-style suspense and autumnal romance. While the film is ultimately unable to fully succeed on either front, it offers many pleasures along the way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ms. Montenegro's rough-hewn integrity is the one quality that ennobles The Other Side of the Street, an otherwise confused mixture of cat-and-mouse thriller and sentimental old folks' love story that is well below the level of "Central Station."</snippet>

         <snippet>Co-writer and first-time director Marcos Bernstein (who also co-scripted the Montenegro-starring Central Station) drowns the film in anesthetizing atmospherics and hot Brazilian bodies, blunting the energy of his septuagenarian star's performance.</snippet>
