         <snippet>From its riveting opening to its gripping conclusion, . . . So Goes the Nation is arguably the most intelligent, kinetic analysis of the modern election process since "The War Room."</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie confirms what most of us have known all along: Electability is all about staying on message.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sticks to reporting. Unlike most political documentaries, it doesn't preach - to the choir or to anyone else.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a conventional political documentary with a conventional view of what happened in the Buckeye State and why, but it's no less fascinating for all that.</snippet>

         <snippet>So Goes the Nation has no new conspiracy theories, settling instead for a meticulous examination of the two political parties' hellbent voter-seduction strategies, from demographic outreach to slam ads.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's triple thesis is that elections are run badly, Democrats are often clueless and Republicans are clever. Maybe--but that still leaves too many unanswered questions.</snippet>

         <snippet>George Bush supporters may think this dissection of the President's narrow and decisive 2004 election victory in Ohio is better than sex. But Democrats and Bush voters who have come to rue the day are more likely to compare it to losing the World Series on a seventh-game walkoff home run.</snippet>
