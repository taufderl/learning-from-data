         <snippet>This belabored summertime sequel is moderately less vulgar, certainly less expensive and, if possible, even less funny than its forerunning bomb, "Daddy Day Care."</snippet>

         <snippet>This terrible sequel to a bad movie was directed by Fred Savage, the now-grown star of "The Wonder Years," though there's no evidence of any behind-the-scenes adult supervision.</snippet>

         <snippet>Any scrap of charm or honest-to-goodness humor already possessed in limited quantities by the original has been relegated to the outhouse in this sorry follow-up.</snippet>

         <snippet>This sequel to the 2003 Eddie Murphy comedy may appeal to auds still young enough not to have seen it all before, or who still find flatulence hilarious, or who think adults, when agitated, flail about like epileptic marionettes.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's gotten to the point where Gooding's presence on a marquee practically guarantees we'll be bashing our heads against the seat in front of us. Bonk, bonk, bonk.</snippet>

         <snippet>The unfunny jokes center on outhouses, vomit and flatulence. Gooding mugs, screeches, even hops up and down to no avail. Nothing can wring an ounce of comedy out of this sorry spectacle.</snippet>

         <snippet>Filling in for Eddie Murphy in a septically humored kiddie sequel to "Daddy Day Care," Gooding gives a mug-job performance that consists mainly of reacting (again and again) to nasty smells.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite cute kids, tough dads, and problems controlling bed-wetting and farts, Daddy Day Camp should just limp off to the nurse's tent and call it quits.</snippet>

         <snippet>About as much fun as being given a wedgie and hung from the camp flagpole, Daddy Day Camp is an unnecessary sequel.</snippet>
