         <snippet>First-time director Kevin Bacon (Mr. Sedgwick) cleverly maintains a balance of discomfiting and familiar by jumping nimbly around Emily's life.</snippet>

         <snippet>Loverboy is a grim little story, but it's leavened unexpectedly with humor and energy. A stylish and thoughtful director, Bacon marries music to image beautifully.</snippet>

         <snippet>Good performances and a keen eye for period detail can't disguise the fact that not much is happening here story-wise.</snippet>

         <snippet>A classic case of "Better if you didn't read the book" cinema, Loverboy emerges an OK character study of an abnormally possessive mother.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bacon the director indulges his wife, letting her play crazy and emotional in a showy performance that screams "serious actress."</snippet>

         <snippet>actor-turned-director Kevin Bacon (Sedgwick's husband) can't seem to decide if he's making a film about a loving eccentric or a sociopath.</snippet>

         <snippet>Almost until the end, Loverboy maintains a shaky integrity. But in its final moments it caves in to convention with a mawkish epilogue to a story that ends with an appalling act of selfishness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bacon instinctively pushes Loverboy toward surreal domestic satire. It's fascinating to watch Sedgwick try to make Emily into a luminous wack job.</snippet>

         <snippet>It all adds up to an unfortunate misfire: a film at odds with both its source material and itself.</snippet>

         <snippet>The real trouble is at its core, with an over-the-top performance from Sedgwick that borders on Baby Jane campiness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though he labors endlessly to account for her behavior, which is explained away by flashbacks to her decadent parents and a glamorous mother-figure played under Vaseline lens by an uncredited Sandra Bullock, Bacon fails to make her seem human.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bacon lavishes his camera on her (Sedgwick) in various states of dress and undress, but the script, by Hannah Shakespeare - talk about having to live up to a name! - is a cheat. It rarely expands on the boy's crises in having to deal with such a mother.</snippet>
