         <snippet>The strange and delightful Talent Given Us is a movie that shouldn't work but does rather remarkably.</snippet>

         <snippet>Limps to a fairly lame conclusion, but until then its remarkable candor is like spending a memorably hilarious, harrowing and unforgettable weekend with your wacky in-laws.</snippet>

         <snippet>One fears, however, that not every uncomfortable scene was scripted, and that we have just been privy to some awfully private moments. It makes for uneasy viewing, sure, but it's one of the most compelling rides around.</snippet>

         <snippet>This isn't a movie, it's a thingamajig - frequently as off-putting as can be, but unassailably one of a kind.</snippet>

         <snippet>The most poignant performance comes from Allen, a retired stock analyst who clings to his masculine pride even though his body's falling apart on him.</snippet>

         <snippet>Autobiographical or not, the frankness and family hysteria of this rolling therapy session gets awkwardly intimate and at times tough to endure, as much for its raw candor as for its confessional contrivance. Too bad the revelations of past mistakes are more interesting than the story played out screen.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's difficult, though, to see how this picture -- essentially chronicling a long car trip -- could mean much to anyone but the Wagners and their friends and relatives.</snippet>

         <snippet>This curious blend of fact and fiction is ultimately worth the trip -- just don't forget to pack the Advil.</snippet>
