         <snippet>As a well-crafted, well-written and well-acted entertainment, it drew me in and got its job done.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's intermittently amusing, and Bening actually gives a performance instead of a star turn, but the claws should have been sharper.</snippet>

         <snippet>English wrangles her talent like a virtuoso. Best is Murphy Brown herself, Candice Bergen.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is Diane English's directing debut, and it shows. Also in evidence is her familiarity with television. The movie is shot like a TV show, with frequent intercut close-ups.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is a feminist lesson instead of what it should have been (and once was): a tough, synthetic, high-gloss entertainment that wears its heart on its lacquered fingernails.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all its current political incorrectness, the original film at least attacked hypocrisy; this one practises it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Women is less about getting even than about inspiring that same mushy sense of female empowerment you might find in a Tyler Perry meller, complete with manic mood swings and full-blown diva moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>It would be sad if Tinseltown used this poorly executed remake as proof that there's no audience for female-driven films, because that's not the case at all.</snippet>

         <snippet>Defanged and drippy, the remake of 1939's The Women seems to have been made for the dullard granddaughters of the sassy, sharp society matrons in George Cukor's campy original.</snippet>

         <snippet>This Women doesn't take place in reality or even in a glamorous urban fantasyland. It's strictly TV Land.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is a work of ambivalence. Is English making fun of these women? Or is she making a pilot for Lifetime?</snippet>

         <snippet>Ryan, barely refining her "When Harry Met Sally" persona, is a dud; Annette Bening, playing the best friend who sells her out to a tabloid, is better in the scenes she doesn't share with her.</snippet>

         <snippet>The whole vibe is so shrill and frantic that the truly accomplished actresses, like Bening and Bergen, are left to flounder. The less nuanced ones -- that would be you, Debra Messing -- are, to use the idiom of the movie, as pleasant to watch as a bikini wax is to feel.</snippet>

         <snippet>Is it an exaggeration to call The Women the worst movie of the year? Well, yeah, probably. But it may be the most disappointing, given all the effort that went into it.</snippet>
