         <snippet>Sandler crony Allen Covert, the star, producer and co-writer of this stunted-adolescence classic, hilariously explores a previously untapped nexus of stoner humor, joystick geekdom, elderly women and a martial arts-taught chimp.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's as aimless and pointless as a joke told while stoned. There are some pretty decent shock-laughs, often provided by Jones, who hasn't ever been this nasty.</snippet>

         <snippet>It cheerfully invites the audience to descend to their level, where no joke is too silly or raunchy, and a plot is just a way of passing time between game levels and bong hits.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even Sandler diehards may pass on this mostly derivative paean to compulsive computer geekdom and male sexual dysfunction.</snippet>

         <snippet>A touch above the usual adolescent male friendly films of Happy Madison's previous on-screen massacres (see "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo" for example‚Äù) but it isn't quite as smart or funny as other recent comedies like "40 Year-Old Virgin" or "Wedding Crashers."</snippet>

         <snippet>The film doesn't have much in the way of genuine laughs despite a plethora of attempted gags, but it does have a geniality that makes it hard to entirely dislike.</snippet>

         <snippet>The sex, fart, and pot jokes come so fast and furious that a white flag seems the most appropriate response.</snippet>

         <snippet>An Adam Sandler movie without Adam Sandler, it turns out, is not necessarily an improvement.</snippet>

         <snippet>Grandma's Boy aspires to nothing more than the frathouse goofiness and juvenile high spirits of early Sandler vehicles, but it possesses the energy of a funeral dirge played at half-speed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Does a very thorough job of reducing every recognizable member of the cast to probable career lows.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lacking so much as a shred of wit and crammed with more product placements than jokes, this unendurable stoner comedy clearly disproves the movie-formula wisdom that two guys, one Xbox and a 2-foot-long bong add up to something funny.</snippet>
