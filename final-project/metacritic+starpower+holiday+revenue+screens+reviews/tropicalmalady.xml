         <snippet>An entirely unconventional, hypnotic, meandering film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Weerasethakul's latest has received mixed responses on the film-festival circuit, yet while it's anything but commercial, it's also anything but unadventurous.</snippet>

         <snippet>A film more textural than narrative, it's for viewers willing to lose themselves in a truly sensual jungle experience.</snippet>

         <snippet>"All of us are by nature wild beasts. We must be like animal trainers and teach ourselves tricks alien to our bestiality." Cutting-edge Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul uses this quote from the novelist Ton Nakajima to introduce his entrancing third feature.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like "Blissfully Yours" and Apichatpong's first feature, the exquisite-corpse road movie "Mysterious Object at Noon" (2000), Tropical Malady promotes new ways of seeing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Shows a young filmmaker pushing at the limits of cinematic narrative with grace and a certain amount of puckish willfulness.</snippet>

         <snippet>In light of Apichatpong Weerasethakul's young career, it's fitting that his beguiling, transfixing romantic fable Tropical Malady splits down the middle into two radically different halves.</snippet>

         <snippet>This challenging, inventive movie from Thailand is not for everyone.</snippet>

         <snippet>It took me two viewings to enjoy the landscape of Weerasethakul's mysterious jungle -- so very thick, steamy, and foreign -- without wishing for clearer trail markers.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a haunted picture, one that feels inhabited not just by actors and scenery but by spirits, too.</snippet>

         <snippet>Takes the viewer on a mysterious and sporadically fascinating trip into the darkness of the human heart and Thai legend.</snippet>

         <snippet>Extremely slow--unbearably so at certain points. And even when there's no action, there's very little dialogue, and we're asked to follow the disjointed and dreamlike story line without the help of anything resembling a narrative.</snippet>

         <snippet>Certainly for most audiences the viewing experience will prove not only tedious but bewildering.</snippet>
