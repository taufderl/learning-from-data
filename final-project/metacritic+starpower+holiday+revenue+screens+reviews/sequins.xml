         <snippet>Faucher's filmmaking is exquisite, Naymark's acting is luminous, and superb use of music lends a crowning touch.</snippet>

         <snippet>A lovely, almost painfully intimate story of female bonding that never panders to its characters or its audience.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eleonore Faucher, first-time director (and co-writer) of the French charmer Sequins, is well aware of Neymark's allure and sees to it that the young woman is seldom out of the frame.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sequins hinges on its performances and newcomer Naymark is a marvel of quiet intelligence, endowing Claire with a complex mix of virginal purity and hormonal rage.</snippet>

         <snippet>But if her wisp of a story rushes the simple connection between the women, the actresses fill in the details with an easy, unforced intimacy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thoughtful cross-generational portrait is full of familiar building blocks rendered fresh by first time feature helmer Eleonore Faucher.</snippet>

         <snippet>Touched with eerie dream sequences, the film casts a strange spell that's enhanced by the rhythmic, almost sensual depiction of the painstaking art of embroidery.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sequins will tax the patience of most viewers not enthralled with endless close-ups of beads and brocades.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ultimately heads into a standard mismatched-buddy drama that would nestle nicely into a Hallmark movie of the week.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, Ms. Faucher's screenplay, written with Gaëlle Macé, never finds its focus or reason for being, and Ms. Naymark just doesn't have enough screen presence to make up for the lack of a story or to justify all those tenderly attentive close-ups.</snippet>
