         <snippet>The film achieves its power through a careful gathering of crucial details, in wordless glances, cruelties of nature and of man and the relentless determination to gain the promised land.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is a straightforward, conventional narrative, charting seemingly endless cruelty and hardship, but rewards the patient with an eloquent climactic sequence that is impossible to predict.</snippet>

         <snippet>Generous in spirit and fearlessly observant, this tale of an outcast Vietnamese man's journey to freedom deserves a place of honor among the great films portraying emigrant tenacity.</snippet>

         <snippet>The script, by newcomer Sabina Murray, is occasionally cloying as the naive hero falls for a bitter prostitute (Bai Ling), but its epic tale of two cultures tragically entwined is anchored by deep and elemental emotions.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the end, it's a heartening, rewarding experience to watch this journey--and, especially, its end.</snippet>

         <snippet>The filmmakers bank against their impulse toward melodrama and deliver a reconciliation that is heartbreakingly understated.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Beautiful Country might be too slow-moving for some, but it has powerful performances and a multi-layered quality. It is an epic journey worth taking.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of those hard-to-pin-down movies where you're not quite sure which sort of story the filmmakers wanted to tell.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Beautiful Country is not a happy film by any means, but it does offer a fragile hope, that beauty exists at the end of every journey, if only one has the strength to finish the trip.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is hard not to admire the independence and ambition of The Beautiful Country, even if the film does fall short of its epic intentions.</snippet>

         <snippet>Standout performance is by Nolte who, in the final 20 minutes, draws on a deep reservoir of playing broken romantic heroes to portray Binh's father. The subtle, resonant scenes between the two men are worth the price of admission.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its visual splendour, The Beautiful Country is indeed lovely to behold, but its story of human misery and survival doesn't always benefit from the painstaking art direction, picturesque vistas and surges of dramatic music.</snippet>

         <snippet>A gorgeous film, framed with an eye that makes every country seem beautiful in one way or another. It's probably fitting that the human element seems fragile and flat by comparison, but the contrast leaves Beautiful Country fairly bland.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Beautiful Country has an epic bearing, but a trite and troubled script makes it more a visual tirade than an engaging odyssey.</snippet>
