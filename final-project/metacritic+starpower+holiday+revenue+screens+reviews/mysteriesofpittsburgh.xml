         <snippet>In the film's most flamboyant role, Peter Sarsgaard's devil-ish charisma and cold bluster is frightening.</snippet>

         <snippet>The full warmth and idiosyncrasy of Chabon's original is missed in an adaptation that feels more impersonally observed. But Lawson's pic, (with the director making a left turn from prior feature "Dodgeball," which he says was a money gig undertaken to hasten this dream project) is entertaining and involving enough on its own terms.</snippet>

         <snippet>Disappointed fans of Michael Chabon will have to watch "Wonder Boys" for solace, for The Mysteries of Pittsburgh boasts only one core mystery: how one can take such promising material and render it completely unmemorable?</snippet>

         <snippet>Remember the final page of Gatsby, a real American tragedy, when the green light beckons us into an ever-receding future? Now that was a mystery. This is, well, Pittsburgh.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is all the more artificial because it has been made with great, almost painful, earnestness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Only Sarsgaard shows a pulse, creating a self-destructive, omnisexual rogue who, for all his faults, would probably be great company. The same can't be said for the film around him.</snippet>

         <snippet>Marries an unengaging love triangle to a flat visual style, nearly squashing the one good thing in it -- a scruffy, slouching performance from Peter Sarsgaard.</snippet>

         <snippet>A coming-of-ager that nearly slaughters you by minute 30 with the relentlessness of its protagonist's voiceovers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mena Suvari, as Art's vindictive ex-fuckbuddy, gives sole signs of life--Miller is so void of presence that one can forget she's in the movie from scene to scene.</snippet>
