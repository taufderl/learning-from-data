         <snippet>Joshua does grow a bit repetitious (it lacks the cathartic climaxes of a horror film), yet it has cool and savvy fun with your fears.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director George Ratliff plays pitch-perfect on the tautly wound strings of our innermost fears that nothing -- not love, wealth or intelligence -- can protect us from the monsters we harbor.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's drama here, and moments of genuine tension, but there's fun, too, which is the point of a movie like this. To Ratliff's credit, he never lets the considerable craft get in the way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Only viewers with some appreciation for the odd, bloodless character of moneyed family life in New York will really understand how hilarious and deadly accurate this movie is. But then again, New York parents are the last people who will want to see it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Poised self-consciously between art and entertainment, Joshua offers imaginative staging and some superb performances.</snippet>

         <snippet>It should be mandatory viewing for right-to-lifers and prospective parents as well as fans of creepy, crawly filmmaking.</snippet>

         <snippet>To lump in this smart, subtle, deviously effective thriller with "The Omen" or "The Good Son" is neither fair nor entirely accurate.</snippet>

         <snippet>Terrifically sneaky psychological thriller, which takes great pleasure in watching carefully constructed family values come tumbling down.</snippet>

         <snippet>Joshua falls a bit flat at the end, but overall it delivers some genuine old-school chills - something that was missing when Macaulay Culkin played a similar role in "The Good Son."</snippet>

         <snippet>First-time director and co-writer George Ratliff skirts, but never quite crosses, the line into absurdity.</snippet>

         <snippet>One of the most diabolical things about this psychological thriller is just how open to interpretation it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Harrowing, controlled and diabolically self-assured, Joshua leaves filmgoers teetering on their own emotional precipice, wondering just where pathos ends and pathology begins.</snippet>

         <snippet>A nifty psychological thriller--part "Bad Seed," part "Rosemary's Baby"--that deals in a manner both comic and creepy with the parental anxieties of a Manhattan haute yuppie family.</snippet>

         <snippet>Part of the fun of Joshua is the skill with which Ratliff juggles horror and realism, feeding one into the other until we become part of the unraveling of the Cairns' perfect life.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ratliff fails to deliver on any of these ideas and the ending falters badly, but as horror flicks go this is both smart and suspenseful.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's regrettable that Joshua veers into outlandish "Omen/Bad Seed/Good Son" territory when the real terror lies much closer to home.</snippet>

         <snippet>So what's wrong with Joshua? Two things: The audience is ahead of the movie, and the movie never catches up.</snippet>

         <snippet>Joshua is the sort of movie in which nobody does what you would do: like spank or demand an extra-strength time out.</snippet>
