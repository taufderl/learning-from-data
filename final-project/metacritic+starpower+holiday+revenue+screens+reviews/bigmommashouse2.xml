         <snippet>BMH2 is a harmless, genial outing, a comedy that is amusing without ever rising to the level of funny. You sit through the film with a smile on your face, waiting for the laughs that never come.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mercifully free of excess mania, sexual innuendo and fart jokes, this sweet-natured comedy, ably directed by John Whitesell (Malibu's Most Wanted), has some nice bits of business.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lawrence is an ingratiating performer, sarcastic and sentimental, and does inventive work with a swivel chair, a bathing suit, and steaming rocks. He's helped along by Emily Procter, who plays the overworked wife and should be freed from "CSI: Miami" as soon as possible.</snippet>

         <snippet>House 2 may never elicit more than mild chuckles, but when Momma teaches the Fullers a few lessons about family, it's heartfelt without being syrupy.</snippet>

         <snippet>This isn't your father's cross-dressing. At the same time, the science of comedy attains a new level of appreciation, since hardly anything about this sluggish sequel to the 2000 box office hit comes close to being funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>If state-of-the-art cross-gender fat suits and drunken Chihuahuas were the stuff of comic genius, Big Momma's House 2 still wouldn't be very funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a sequel so bad that even Cedric the Entertainer and Anthony Anderson didn't return for it, let alone Terrence Howard and Paul Giamatti.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lawrence is a comedian with talent who rarely uses it for anything worthwhile, and here he makes a halfhearted, paycheck-collecting effort that's actually in perfect keeping with the rest of the movie's tired, recycled tone.</snippet>

         <snippet>If there is a casting agent in hell, ­Martin Lawrence and Tyler Perry will soon put on their fat suits as Big Momma and Madea Simmons and show up as a tag team in a big-screen ­Wrestlemania.</snippet>

         <snippet>All told, however, this bland little movie fits right into it's late January slot. It's a little bawdy - the fat-lady thong bit was funnier in "Shallow Hall" - and it passes the time.</snippet>

         <snippet>So episodic and flat it should be a letdown even to those amused by the original.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is an incredibly disorganized movie with a few funny scenes -- most of which are revealed in the commercials.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a shame to once again witness Martin Lawrence squander his considerable comic talents under a fat suit and fake breasts in this shoddy sequel.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you experience any laughter while in the presence of this movie, it's a credit to your imagination. But if you can tickle yourself, why spend the $10.75?</snippet>
