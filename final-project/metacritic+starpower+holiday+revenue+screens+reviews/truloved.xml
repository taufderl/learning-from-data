         <snippet>Tru Loved is worth a look for the supporting cast alone.</snippet>

         <snippet>It isn't unique visually and a lot of the acting is what, at best, could be called amateur.</snippet>

         <snippet>May not be the best-made movie in the world, but its considerable heart cannot be denied.</snippet>

         <snippet>And, more important, does the world need yet another peppy gay self-esteem indie like Tru Loved? Probably not, though the writer and director Stewart Wade pulls this one off with heart.</snippet>

         <snippet>Writer-director Stewart Wade's Tru Loved is a kitschier incarnation of an after-school special: hokey and simplistic, but also gawkily sweet-natured.</snippet>

         <snippet>Picture is savvy enough to package a gay-sensitivity-training crash course in terms that will overcome most young auds' resistance, although discriminating adults might roll their eyes at some baldly manipulative and stereotypical elements.</snippet>

         <snippet>Tru Loved as a movie is on about the same level as a not especially good high school play.</snippet>
