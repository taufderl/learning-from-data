         <snippet>Beautifully played by Valette and Zylberstein, and directed with amazing grace by Albou, this touching film offers a respectful, fascinating look at a community that's ignored as often as it's misunderstood.</snippet>

         <snippet>The sensuality is never salacious, merely curious, and the message is empowering ... at least within the confines of the insular community.</snippet>

         <snippet>Philosophy and religion become entangled with love and sex in Karin Albou's intelligent, sensual drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Albou's chosen a touchy subject, which she treats sensitively. Her mature script is complemented by heartfelt turns by Fanny Valette as Laura and Elsa Zylberstein as Mathilde.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film, both light-hearted and serious, suggests that freedom comes more easily within restrictions--and that's true of Albou's approach as well.</snippet>

         <snippet>For the first full hour, as we're guided inside privacies of culture and consciousness, Ms. Albou sustains her rich and gently intoxicating mode of storytelling, a feat all the more admirable in light of the overly schematic script.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stylish and well-observed while ultimately not adding up to very much.</snippet>

         <snippet>In what is arguably her best performance since "Van Gogh," Zylberstein brings Mathilde to life with grace and fervor.</snippet>

         <snippet>It would be hard to imagine a filmmaking style as serious yet lazy as the earnest vérité bobbing and weaving employed by La Petite Jérusalem.</snippet>

         <snippet>Writer-director Karin Albou nicely balances intellect against spirituality but is defeated by the sex scenes, which are tinged with an Orientalist exoticism; the result is a bodice-ripper for the art-house crowd.</snippet>

         <snippet>Understandably, a script so obsessed with the dark doings of plot has little time left over for the study of character, and, thus, we never really get to know these people.</snippet>
