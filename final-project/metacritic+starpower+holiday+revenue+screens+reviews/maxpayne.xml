         <snippet>A dumb film with a great conceptual hook from a director who visualizes better than he dramatizes.</snippet>

         <snippet>For a movie of its type, Max Payne is a little short on excitement and heavy on pathos.</snippet>

         <snippet>Simple, it is as by-the-books formulaic as can be, and there's not a surprise around that the corner that isn't obvious immediately.</snippet>

         <snippet>Max Payne, game or movie, has precious little to say.</snippet>

         <snippet>The attempts to out-Matrix "The Matrix," with bullet-time super-slo mo, are staged with such theatrics that they're unintentionally funny. This movie also has "Blade Runner" on its mind, and Raymond Chandler, but mostly it's a weak little sister to "Sin City."</snippet>

         <snippet>The film provides ample opportunity to attack the MPAA's hypocrisy. Max Payne is a bloodbath, yet it manages a PG-13 rating by keeping the explicitness of the killings just a whisker shy of what would be necessary for an R.</snippet>

         <snippet>At least in a video game the player decides who needs to be killed, and what trail to take in the labyrinth. The Max Payne moviegoers are passive hostages on a long ride they've taken so many times before.</snippet>

         <snippet>In a post-Matrix, post-John Woo world, a handful of slow-motion shootouts shouldn't be all that's on offer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Max’s righteous anger finds various allies and targets, though it is not always clear who is which. They are played by Mila Kunis, Beau Bridges and Ludacris with just enough panache and expressiveness to uphold the (increasingly irrelevant) distinction between a movie and a video game.</snippet>

         <snippet>A film that feels far too familiar for the likes of Wahlberg to juice up, hallucinatory valkyries or no.</snippet>

         <snippet>This tired, neutered action thriller won't cause you max pain, but you might wince every now and again.</snippet>

         <snippet>What kills Max Payne is that the characters think and feel in slow motion. Half the time, mentally, they're just running in place.</snippet>

         <snippet>Max Payne couldn't be more appropriately named. Sitting through this stylish-looking but derivative, vacuous and bullet-riddled movie inflicts maximum pain.</snippet>

         <snippet>A banal revenge melodrama-cum-detective story, but fans of the video game on which it is based should not be alarmed.</snippet>

         <snippet>This highly stylized adaptation of the popular Max Payne video game is 70 percent dark, snowy atmospherics and 30 percent loud, violent action.</snippet>

         <snippet>With its flat story, numbed-out protagonist, and faux artistic lighting and set design - everything is dark or moody or darkishly moody or moodily dark - Max Payne seems a good half hour longer than its running time.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is not a movie that has great passion for pleasures of the flesh. Its sexiest scenes involve bullets cutting through the air in the slowest motion possible.</snippet>

         <snippet>Max Payne offers max pain along with min invention, and the only thing that keeps it out of the bottom of the Dumpster--it’s more of a top-of-the-Dumpster movie--is the presence of Mark Wahlberg.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story has more holes than a shot-up metal door, the acting feels bored at best, and the intermittent action, while passable, hardly makes up for the downtime.</snippet>
