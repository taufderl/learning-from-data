         <snippet>This is a modest, thoughtful, independent production of exceptional insight and quietly devastating power.</snippet>

         <snippet>A solid performance by the often underrated Judith Light lends considerable weight to this melodrama's controversial subject.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even those of us who find anti-homosexual ''deprogramming'' to be hideously intolerant and naive may find ourselves oddly relieved that Mark is there (in a Christian rehab center).</snippet>

         <snippet>What's admirable about Save Me is that it grounds its religious and cultural debate not in vilifying one side but in sympathizing with both.</snippet>

         <snippet>Save Me is a particularly flattering showcase for Gant, best known for his work on the TV show "Queer as Folk" and ready for a big-screen breakout.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though Save Me never quite surmounts its schematic scenario, scene by scene, beat by beat, it's pretty damn good.</snippet>

         <snippet>Allen and Gant are principals in Mythgarden, a movie production company that promotes gay and lesbian storytelling, and Save Me makes a respectable showing as an early effort.</snippet>

         <snippet>An earnest drama about the futility of "rescuing" gay men back to Jesus, Save Me presents a paradox: It's an issue drama in which the most compassionately drawn character is on the other side of the issue.</snippet>

         <snippet>The first feature from new gay-focused production company Mythgarden, is a welcome exception in that it effectively dramatizes the issues without caricaturing or pillorizing either party.</snippet>

         <snippet>Never quite shakes off its aura of second-rate made-for-TV movie, Save Me has a lot of heart but little nerve and no surprise.</snippet>

         <snippet>For its intention to promulgate the compatibility of Christianity with homosexuality, Save Me deserves a footnote in the political battle between these traditionally adversarial groups. As a movie, it doesn't amount to much more than an after school-special with sex and profanity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sounds like a great idea for a gay porno, but the soapy Save Me actually takes itself seriously.</snippet>
