         <snippet>While roving interviewer Ben Stein extracts some choice soundbites from scientists on both sides of the creation-vs.-evolution debate, the film's flippant approach undermines the seriousness of its discourse, trading less in facts than in emotional appeals.</snippet>

         <snippet>It puts a conservative twist on Michael Moore-ism, with campy stock footage, deadpan humor, mocking musical cues and less-than-ingenuous questions.</snippet>

         <snippet>While he gets points for addressing the debate, the way in which Stein goes about it undermines his efforts to be even-handed and intellectually rigorous.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's hard to pinpoint what's most insulting about this obvious propaganda piece.</snippet>

         <snippet>Expelled is an unprincipled propaganda piece that insults believers and nonbelievers alike.</snippet>

         <snippet>As a work of nonfiction filmmaking it is a sham and as agitprop it is too flimsy to strike any serious blows.</snippet>

         <snippet>Managing to make the films of Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock look like dry, scholarly treatises by comparison, Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed more than lives up to its subtitle.</snippet>

         <snippet>A straightforward account of the debate between evolutionists and ID proponents might have been both entertaining and enlightening; instead this follows the avuncular Ben Stein (who cowrote the movie) as he jet-sets around the globe trying to prove that a cabal of Darwinians has conspired to destroy academic freedom.</snippet>

         <snippet>Regardless of your personal views, Expelled's heavy-handed bias (a visit to Darwin's home gets the same eerie music as a tour of Dachau) is exasperating.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stein's schlumpy presence is disarming, though his know-it-all nature is at odds with his free-speech posing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Surely there's a more nuanced argument to be made in favor of ID than pinning the old "bad as Hitler" canard on pro-evolution scientists?</snippet>

         <snippet>Make Ben Stein some more money (and get a good, mordant chuckle while you're at it) by checking out this loopy, factually befuddled documentary that should manage the not-inconsiderable feat of insulting Christians, Jews, Muslims, and those nutty sci-guys who go in for Darwin by way of bad teeth and Einsteinian hair styles.</snippet>
