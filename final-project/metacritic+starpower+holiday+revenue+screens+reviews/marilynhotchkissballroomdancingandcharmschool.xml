         <snippet>This film does other power-of-dance movies one better by downplaying the dancing and underscoring what its brethren often lack: a compelling, wrenching and wonderfully inspiring story.</snippet>

         <snippet>As absorbingly weird and dark and sad as the film becomes, it still labors against jumpy construction, an irritating variety of visual styles and film stocks, and a crowded story that no one gets much individual screen time, which means that redemption for everyone comes far too quickly and neatly.</snippet>

         <snippet>Expanded by writer-director Randall Miller from a nostalgic half-hour short he made while a student at AFI, this well-intentioned film about loss, grief and new beginnings gets bogged down in syrupy cliches and blunt self-help dialogue.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie delivers the promised ballroom action, but not the charm. And if you think the title is endless, wait till you see Goodman's death scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>Overall it's got two left feet - and charm is in dangerously short supply.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is an elegiac journey to a sweeter, more civilized place in the heart. Predictable and decidedly old-fashioned in its sensibility, the film is likely to win over audiences if not critics.</snippet>

         <snippet>Really, about all that unifies the movie is its inclination to turn little people's dreams into limply ''affectionate'' camp.</snippet>

         <snippet>The story is corny and predictable, but Carlyle's subtle, nuanced performance saves the movie from drowning in sentimentality.</snippet>

         <snippet>I wish I could say there is something pleasurable in watching John Goodman reminisce about the good old days while impaled on a steering wheel in the Volvo he's crashed on a California freeway, but I can't find what it is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite a gloriously baroque performance from Mr. Wahlberg - attempting moves certified only for Antonio Banderas - Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School remains irredeemably soggy.</snippet>

         <snippet>This flat-footed male weepie musters an insurance ad's worth of clich√©s about the importance of busting a move in middle age-and it strains so hard to do so that it's almost perversely compelling.</snippet>

         <snippet>An attempt at a beautiful film about renewal -- about past love, love lost, longing and rediscovery -- but it has no emotional truth.</snippet>
