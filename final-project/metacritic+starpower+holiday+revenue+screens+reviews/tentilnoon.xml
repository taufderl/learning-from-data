         <snippet>This could've easily been a giant mess, but aiding filmmaker Scott Storm in keeping his ship together is a talented ensemble cast who compliment the sharp, witty script by writer Paul Osborne. You're never too lost in trying to figure out why this poor guy is doomed and you're always entertained. Talent coming in from all sides makes Ten ‘til Noon great movie watching.</snippet>

         <snippet>A triumph of ingenuity over budget, a taut, darkly comic thriller with a dart of pathos that holds attention like Super Glue from the first frame to the last.</snippet>

         <snippet>Paul Osborne's script delivers an intriguing structure, though dialogue tastes like something warmed over after 12 years in Quentin Tarantino's freezer.</snippet>

         <snippet>In more experienced hands, perhaps a great story could be told, but Ten ’Til Noon has two major factors working against it. First, the acting is wildly uneven...Second, once the conspiracy is more or less revealed, the story ceases to be interesting.</snippet>
