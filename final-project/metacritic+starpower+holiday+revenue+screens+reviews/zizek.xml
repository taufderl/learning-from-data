         <snippet>Zizek as a larger-than-life figure who manages to engage you even when you're not entirely sure what he's going on about.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film attempts to put Zizek's philosophy into practical, accessible terms. Accessible, of course, being a relative term.</snippet>

         <snippet>The documentary bravely risks giving Zizek its own one-way hug.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a straightforward, relatively style-free piece, primarily of interest to those who want to hear Zizek's pronouncements. But what distinguishes the film is Zizek's peculiar self-awareness, which borders on paranoia</snippet>

         <snippet>Zizek is a revolutionary playing a comedian playing a revolutionary. Which makes him worth watching, even in this movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>A little bit of Slovene philosopher Slavoj Zizek goes a long way. In the verbose profile documentary Zizek! there's a lot of esoteric, eccentric theories, and little context within his globetrotting life.</snippet>

         <snippet>Taylor traipses around after Zizek on a continent-hopping lecture tour, and we get a face full of the man's tireless analysis, in a style that can only be characterized as hyperactive grizzly bear, complete with spit-spewing speech impediment.</snippet>

         <snippet>Entertaining without being especially illuminating. If you must see only one documentary about a Slovene philosopher this year, it might be better to read his books.</snippet>
