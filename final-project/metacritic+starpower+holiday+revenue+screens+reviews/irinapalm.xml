         <snippet>Faithfull is marvelous: Once notorious for her own escapades, this great-great-niece of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch is no shrinking violet, but she's perfect as a plump, frumpy widow with a huge heart and a hidden talent no one would ever suspect.</snippet>

         <snippet>It turns out a success, tempering its farfetched scenario with enough restraint and believability to pass for a modest parable of modern manners.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sam Garbarski's use of slow-motion shots is pretentious, and he paces the film too slowly. But he captures the seedy side of London, giving you a feel for Soho during the day when sunshine exposes a cheap gaudiness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Garbarski recovers from the melodrama with a final image that is so sweet, so simple and so understated that one is tempted to say it is perfect.</snippet>

         <snippet>Marianne Faithfull is unforgettable as a middle-class, middle-aged frump â€¦in Sam Garbarski's crowd-pleasing comedy-drama Irina Palm.</snippet>

         <snippet>Genially preposterous and pleasantly diverting, it balances calculation against humanity and generally comes out on top.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's a heartwarming quality that softens the hardcore setting but this does lack an assured, er, hand.</snippet>

         <snippet>Irina Palm is, for the most part, a phony trifle, but at its heart, somehow, is a real and fascinating person.</snippet>

         <snippet>The demand for her services is so great that she suffers from "penis elbow," but her popularity also brings self-esteem and a possible boyfriend in her boss (Miki Manojlovic) in this lethargically directed comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The dopey premise only takes to a gross extreme the "Full Monty" formula that the Brits have been milking for more than a decade.</snippet>

         <snippet>Doesn't deliver on a lot of fronts. But then again it gives us full-on Faithfull, who manages to bare herself completely without ever actually getting undressed.</snippet>

         <snippet>Plays like a throwback to gritty-but-softhearted English dramas of the 1980s like "Mona Lisa" and "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid."</snippet>

         <snippet>Mixed messages are the order of the day in the conflicted British drama Irina Palm. At first blush, it seems like another entry in the saucy-but-safe Brit genre, a la "Calendar Girls," "Saving Grace" or "The Full Monty," but it turns out to be both more ambitious and less successful than those diversions.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is, however, a baby boomer's treat to see Faithfull, romancer of Mick Jagger back in the day and a pop siren in her own right, show her qualities as an actor. One is hopeful she'll find her way to other, better projects.</snippet>

         <snippet>Astonishingly, pic reaped hearty guffaws at Berlinale press show, suggesting this might play best in Europe, but Anglophone auds are more likely to give Palm the thumbs down.</snippet>

         <snippet>Nobody can reduce tawdry material to doddering quaintness like the British, but this staggeringly inane joint effort of U.K., Belgian, French, German, and Luxembourgian film financing represents a true coalition of the witless.</snippet>
