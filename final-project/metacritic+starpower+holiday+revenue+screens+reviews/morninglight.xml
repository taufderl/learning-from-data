         <snippet>The documentary is enjoyable, though it could have been edited more tightly. The ending, in which three of the contest participants write and perform a catchy pop song, is buoyantly fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>An OK sports doc that owes as much to reality TV competitions as it does to the genre of nautical cinema.</snippet>

         <snippet>A Disney movie about a Disney project, this slick sailing documentary feels a little too self-promotional, almost like an attraction you might stumble into at Epcot. But at least it turns out to be a fairly wild ride.</snippet>

         <snippet>An old-fashioned doc about a sailboat race is well produced but lacks urgency and true insight</snippet>

         <snippet>Like the disastrously overpopulated "Amazing Race: Family Edition," Morning Light never finds a way to make us care who wins.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is more appealing for its scenery, which is as breathtakingly blue as you'd expect, than for its drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>At one point during the big race, the kids get passed at close range by a team of pros so seasoned, they wrote the navigation software the kids use. I was begging the camera crew to follow them.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film feels more like the ultimate scrapbook for the participants than the vicarious thrill the pair no doubt imagined for audiences.</snippet>

         <snippet>Two unnerving phenomena--the popularity of reality-TV competitions and the Walt Disney Company's ability to churn out entertainment starring the most squeaky-clean humans on earth--come together in Morning Light, a nightmarishly upbeat documentary.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the makers were hoping they'd chronicled a metaphor for life's struggle, they probably weren't counting on the struggle being monotony.</snippet>
