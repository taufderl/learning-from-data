         <snippet>A wrenching, funny and wise little picture, with a diva-like junior star at its center.</snippet>

         <snippet>Brilliantly, the movie becomes a double coming-of-age story. The parents' political awakening parallels their daughter's.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film contains a surprising amount of understated humor. It is not a grim portrayal of a harsh upbringing, but an affectionate portrait of parents who will be able to change the world before they will be able to change their daughter.</snippet>

         <snippet>Blame It on Fidel is the thoroughly engaging, clear-eyed and charming story of a little girl grappling with the domestic fallout of tumultuous political times.</snippet>

         <snippet>But while Kervel will probably have to have her own children before she fully understands the changes parents go through, she's bound to adjust to her folks' whims. Having no power of her own, what choice does she have?</snippet>

         <snippet>Blame It on Fidel doesn't aim for the profundity of Costa-Gavras films like "State of Siege" and "Z" - but who's complaining?</snippet>

         <snippet>The real treasure here is newcomer Kervel, a child superstar in the making.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite the seriousness of the subject, the movie is sweet and charming; it knows that audiences hate to be preached to and instead shows us--as it shows a Anna--why we should care about being humane.</snippet>

         <snippet>Documentary filmmaker Julie Gavras has made a successful transition into narratives with the remarkably assured, thoroughly delightful Blame It on Fidel.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a movie of deceptive lightness and powerful sweep. And what makes it truly work is the presence of Kervel, a first-time actor whose Anna is disarmingly self-assured and sweet. Without her, nothing else matters.</snippet>

         <snippet>The young heroine is rather humorless, but Gavras's intelligence and skillful touch are evident throughout.</snippet>

         <snippet>Gavras’ ending makes it clear where her sympathies lie. In the process of building to that conclusion, she overplays her metaphor a bit, but still, political tracts rarely come this sweet and sympathetic.</snippet>
