         <snippet>The actors are terrific, especially Weaving, who plays bottoming out as a tragedy spiked with gallows humor, and Blanchett, who digs deep into the booby-trapped nature of recovery. The revelation, however, is Rowan Woods, a major filmmaker in the making.</snippet>

         <snippet>Confrontational, raw and always compelling, Little Fish is a film of rare power and conviction.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's title refers both to tiny, fish-shaped vials of liquid heroin and the small fry flitting around the edges of the urban drug scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>Blessed with stellar performances, especially by lead Cate Blanchett as an ex-junkie looking for a fresh break, this sophomore feature by Australian director Rowan Woods marks a strong return after his powerful debut, "The Boys" (1998).</snippet>

         <snippet>While Little Fish takes a turn for the generic in its final act, solid acting, an atmospheric soundtrack, and flare-filled cinematography more beautiful than an Apple screensaver are enough to keep the film afloat.</snippet>

         <snippet>As in all her screen performances, Ms. Blanchett immerses herself completely in her character, a damaged, high-strung woman determined to live the straight life while surrounded by temptation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Little Fish is a small film about one family and drugs, but it succeeds in standing for a larger social catastrophe.</snippet>

         <snippet>Strong performances and meticulous direction make this consistently disconcerting, but the subplot distracts from the moving human drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>Why was this pointless movie made? Because quality actors like Blanchett and Weaving like to play drug addicts. They can't stop themselves. They need help.</snippet>
