         <snippet>Helmed by Steve Sawalich, this real-life dramedy is anchored by Michael Sheenâ€™s captivating performance as the severely handicapped, profoundly acerbic Art Honeyman.</snippet>

         <snippet>Livingston and director Steven Sawalich keep the character in constant motion, his dialogue sprinkled with humor and his energy contagious. The film also is surrounded by a crew of ferociously individualistic characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>Movies often don't do their stories justice, and that has happened again here. The main problem is a tone that jarringly switches from a kind of Forrest Gump-style narrative to a more generic biopic.</snippet>

         <snippet>The performances are all solid, but Sheen, last seen as Tony Blair in "The Queen," is so good in his incredibly demanding role that he makes the natural discomfort people feel at seeing someone so debilitated disappear completely.</snippet>

         <snippet>As with many biopics, Richard is seen as the perfect hero, a man who singlehandedly changed the way the United States treats its disabled citizens. That's a bit of a stretch.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's everything it ought to be: right-minded, well-intentioned, compassionate. But it doesn't rise above made-for-cable public service announcement, either.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sheen, like the movie itself, is trying too hard to inspire when the story doesn't need the help.</snippet>

         <snippet>If it does nothing else, Music Within shows us how deeply Ron Livingston's amiable face can take us into a movie. But even likable mugs like his -- remember him in "Office Space"? -- need help from the movies around them.</snippet>

         <snippet>It gives me no pleasure to report that the Pimentel biopic Music Within plays like a well-intentioned TV movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is that they never truly find the innate drama in Pimentel's story, instead simply recounting four or five decades' worth of events that shaped the man.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sheen is often the saving grace of Music Within, thanks to an aggressively profane wit that gives an otherwise tapioca-bland story a little edge.</snippet>
