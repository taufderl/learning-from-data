         <snippet>The Farrelly brothers could burp out a movie funnier than The Hottie &amp; the Nottie, a farce of corrupt stereotypes that's never more grotesque than when it pretends to be more than skin-deep.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like Nate, we are mere Notties. And we are supposed to feel oh-so privileged for getting to watch Paris through the glass.</snippet>

         <snippet>Great actors make the craft look easy. In the Paris Hilton comedy The Hottie and the Nottie, acting looks very, very difficult.</snippet>

         <snippet>You've got to admire Hilton's complete conviction in herself as the center of all that is beautiful and good. And maybe such unwavering self-regard is actually kind of hot. Or not.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though Hilton may be a model, if her work in Hottie is any indication, she is no actress.</snippet>

         <snippet>That generous half star rating I tacked onto  this comedy abomination is all for Paris Hilton. Come on, it takes guts (or gross dim-wittedness) to appear on screen again after "House of Wax."</snippet>

         <snippet>A cinematic excursion so horrific that it's an insult to bad movies to call it a bad movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Paris Hilton has already ushered a remarkable three features into the Internet Movie Database's "Bottom 100." The Hottie and the Nottie will make it an even four.</snippet>

         <snippet>How is Paris Hilton in her first starring role to receive a national release? Pretty bad, actually. She's limited to a single, all-too-familiar expression of smug self-satisfaction, and she delivers her lines in a tone somewhere between "seductive" and "dish-soap commercial."</snippet>

         <snippet>The most astounding thing about this abysmal comedy -- aside from the fact the studio actually allowed critics within a mile of it -- is that it's so ghastly it is beneath even the meager dignity of Paris Hilton.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not like Paris Hilton to rise above her material, but The Hottie and the Nottie sinks so low that all she has to do is stand upright.</snippet>

         <snippet>Custom designed for its smirking star (who is also an executive producer), this tasteless train wreck asks only that she preen and prance on cue.</snippet>
