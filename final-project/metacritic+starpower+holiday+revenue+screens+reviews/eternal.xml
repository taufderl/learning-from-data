         <snippet>Much of the film rests on the shoulders of Conrad Pla who plays Raymond Pope. He is the focus of the movie and proves himself an excellent leading man.</snippet>

         <snippet>A handsome package whose atmospherics outclass merely serviceable plot and character elements.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's nothing wrong with formulas when they work, but Eternal is neither scary nor particularly sexy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eternal isn't that bad. Actually, it is. But it's kind of fun, too, in a way only cheesy exploitation films can be fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>That the acting is stilted and that the filmmakers and especially Pla take themselves so seriously serves to make Eternal deliriously silly camp fare.</snippet>

         <snippet>Lush, lurid and completely besotted with itself, Eternal is one of those movies normally found slinking around the ether of late-night cable television.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ending doesn't really work, and Pla tends to overplay what's already a larger-than-life character, but Neron is perfect as the striking and cucumber-cool countess.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fairly sexy and stylish. Alas, it's also quite silly and not especially scary.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's impossible to overstate the silliness of all this, but it would still be a decent Halloween trick - if it were Halloween.</snippet>

         <snippet>Turns out to be semi-enjoyable, semi-tacky retelling/updating of the old Elizabeth Bathory legend.</snippet>

         <snippet>As the cop who finds himself in way over his head, kickboxer-turned-actor Conrad Pla turns in a performance of such staggering ineptitude that it almost (key word: almost) reaches a so-bad-it's-good, Plan 9 From Outer Space brilliance.</snippet>

         <snippet>"It is a study of the psychopathologies of perversions," co-director Federico Sanchez says in the press notes for Eternal, which is certainly one way to rationalize a trashy lesbian vampire flick.</snippet>
