         <snippet>Who knew that the franchise’s creators would eventually find a plot twist that made sense?</snippet>

         <snippet>Warm feelings are inspired by the reappearance of old friends, even those who had their faces ripped off or their intestines ejected several films ago.</snippet>

         <snippet>Conveys a much louder political message and the implementation of violence reflects as much.</snippet>

         <snippet>There’s still too much flashback material here about apprentices and evil cops. But if you’ve ever raged at nameless, insensitive service people, you won’t mind seeing them strapped into a rotating turret, the shotgun cocking.</snippet>

         <snippet>It might well be time for a creative rebooting; the freshness, if not the viscera, has begun to strongly diminish.</snippet>

         <snippet>Because Saw does nothing to alter the look, tone, and engineered gimmickry from one movie to the next, it keeps going deeper into backstory and character arcs than horror series past, as if this ugly, cheap-looking schlock were somehow "The Lord Of The Rings."</snippet>

         <snippet>A film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called "Saw It Already."</snippet>

         <snippet>For fans, however, Saw VI is, pardon the pun, a cut above the rest but not, sadly, by much.</snippet>

         <snippet>Taken just as an objet d’art, Saw VI — gray, grisly, solemn, stupid — would be about the most dismal thing I’ve ever laid eyes on, the argument against film preservation. But it vaults into the realm of real detestability through pretensions of relevance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?</snippet>
