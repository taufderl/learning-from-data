         <snippet>Carries an important and timely reminder about the fate of torture victims, so deftly wrapped within a touching and beautifully acted melodrama that the result is the furthest thing from a didactic message movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like Ceylan--like many a fine director--Coixet has made her film less as a drama than as the traversal of a state of mind, a mood.</snippet>

         <snippet>Yes, The Secret Life of Words owes much to Lars von Trier's 1999 "Breaking the Waves." But Coixet's riff stands on its own thanks to thoughtful performances by Polley and Robbins.</snippet>

         <snippet>Given the physical limitations of their characters, Polley and Robbins give remarkably compelling performances, and though the resolution of their slowly evolving relationship is a bit too pat, it is one you won't soon forget.</snippet>

         <snippet>The exquisitely coordinated performances elicit an empathy as powerful as anything I can remember feeling in a recent film.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sarah Polley gives a wonderfully searching performance, as a woman in a state of extreme isolation, in The Secret Life of Words, a compellingly claustrophobic drama set mostly aboard an oil rig.</snippet>

         <snippet>A series of conversations that are sometimes clever and sometimes feel like screenwriting exercises about the details of life, but are always well acted.</snippet>

         <snippet>There may be no young actress today better at embodying a blend of wounded innocence and stoic pride than Sarah Polley. In The Secret Life of Words, she has a part worthy of her gifts.</snippet>

         <snippet>Can a single scene save a movie? An hour and 20 minutes into The Secret Life of Words, Sarah Polley delivers a halting, evocative 10-minute monologue that finally unlocks the mystery behind her guarded character.</snippet>

         <snippet>A tantalizing and beautiful picture made with tremendous integrity, and anchored by two marvelous performances, Isabel Coixet's The Secret Life of Words still, somehow, doesn't quite work.</snippet>

         <snippet>In due course skeletons will march out of closets, but the movie yields up its secrets with slow reluctance.</snippet>
