         <snippet>Director Roth has accomplished the near impossible with Hostel: Part II: He's crafted a vastly superior sequel to a film already considered something of a classic by genre aficionados, one that supersedes its predecessor's sadistic entertainment quotient by orders of magnitude while also upstaging its own outrageous gore effects with a script that's smart, vicious, and occasionally, gleefully subversive.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the sequel isn't as unrelentingly gory as the original, there are still rivers of blood.</snippet>

         <snippet>In this twist-filled sequel, the real shocker is just how smart and satisfying such degradation can be. There's no question "Part II" outgrosses the original "Hostel" in the blood-and-guts department.</snippet>

         <snippet>Given its premise, it's hard for any Hostel  sequel to be little more than a rehash.</snippet>

         <snippet>May not be your idea of a fun European vacation, but Roth's trip offers horror fans more than the usual sick kicks.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hostel II is far too shrewd and savagely witty to be caught engaging in higher seriousness. Roth could probably go even further with this particular franchise if he wanted to. Yet somehow, I think he's meant for grander, subtler and more intricate distractions than this.</snippet>

         <snippet>Roth's slick shock-'em-up sequel is a dispiritingly traditional splat of gristly Grand Guignol. It's tooled up to outrage, but ultimately numbs rather than grips.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Roth, part of a new breed of horror directors affectionately labeled the "Splat Pack," is regarded by some as a savior of the genre, though it could be argued that he is more effectively a saboteur. He might have mastered the cheap sadism-as-entertainment gross-out, but he has yet to produce a single genuine, old-fashioned fright.</snippet>

         <snippet>The filmmakers behind the "Saw" franchise must love to see a movie like Hostel: Part II.
Compared to this Eli Roth fetish video, the "Saw" films are Oscar bait.</snippet>
