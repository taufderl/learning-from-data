         <snippet>Swing Vote marries mild satire with Capra-esque melodrama in a formula that works surprisingly well.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie is a genial comedy, but it has significant undertones. Like some of Frank Capra's pictures.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film seems like a loose and uncredited updating of "The Great Man Votes," a more serious 1939 entry.</snippet>

         <snippet>Swing Vote is messy and its targets are relatively safe. But its aim is true. And Costner's performance hits the bull's-eye.</snippet>

         <snippet>The thing is far too absurd and broadly played for its own good.</snippet>

         <snippet>The mix of comedy and drama is winning; Costner couldn't be better, and the little girl is a find.</snippet>

         <snippet>Picture's comic smarts and affecting daddy-daughter drama provide a sturdy platform for its heartfelt advocacy of informed voting and responsible citizenship.</snippet>

         <snippet>Costner does something difficult: In the middle of a tepid comic whirlpool, he finds the humorous aspect of inertia.</snippet>

         <snippet>This reasonably entertaining movie falters by trying to be both a dark comedy and a sentimental treatise on family and country.</snippet>

         <snippet>This one may be soft and derivative. But the actors establish a groove and stay on-message.</snippet>

         <snippet>This light satire is unlikely to influence the forthcoming election, but Costner's in fine fettle.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the title hadn't already been taken by another equally strained recent comedy, the new Kevin Costner vehicle could have been dubbed "Idiocracy."</snippet>

         <snippet>Dusted off and brought up to date, it's still the same old Capracorn â€“ minus the populist pizzazz he might have provided.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is a killer idea for a political satire, and screenwriters Jason Richman and Joshua Michael Stern come close to realizing its farcical potential.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's not nearly as idiotic as its trailer made it seem, because it's not really about voting, or politics.</snippet>

         <snippet>Everyone, including the candidates, will recognize the importance of civic duty, leaving Swing Vote to end with swelling music and uplifting speechifying but on a completely unsatisfactory note.</snippet>

         <snippet>The longer Swing Vote hangs around, the more engaging it becomes. It's twice as smart as you have any reason to expect but still only half as smart as you wish it were.</snippet>

         <snippet>Hopelessly muddled film cries out for the firm hand of a dyed-in-the-wool cynic like Billy Wilder, who would have put some teeth in its jabs at amoral politicians and blindly ambitious journalists.</snippet>
