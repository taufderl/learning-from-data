         <snippet>Despite its deficiencies, and the inadequate screen time allotted to Theron (who's quite good), Sleepwalking has a core of feeling. It's about a do-gooder who, lacking all skills for it, does good anyway. His emotional odyssey has real poignancy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Stanford's script is painfully obvious, right down to the line of dialogue spelling out the title's significance.</snippet>

         <snippet>Portentous and dull, the film features one of the worst over-the-top performances by Dennis Hopper, who plays an abusive father.</snippet>

         <snippet>Well-intentioned to a fault, Sleepwalking blurs the line between dramatizing free-floating misery and spreading it.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s a shame that this film’s star-studded cast wasn’t able to save the mediocre storyline.</snippet>

         <snippet>The overly simplistic script by Zac Stanford (“The Chumscrubber”) hits nothing but high notes, making the whole dramatically less than the sum of its parts.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie seems unusually honest in portraying the no-option existence of the working poor, but the story slips into melodrama in the last reel.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's because of AnnaSophia Robb's performance...I don't think you'll see a more fascinating and nuanced performance at the movies this year.</snippet>

         <snippet>But the regularly overlooked Stahl burrows honestly into this unpleasant place, adding another worthy portrait to his indie gallery of interesting losers. He's still an actor worth keeping your eyes on. Assuming you can keep them open.</snippet>

         <snippet>Terrific performances and a bleak, riveting look at life on the economic fringes eventually gives way to an overly familiar tale of abuse, denial and catharsis that feels like warmed over Sam Shepard minus the poetry.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie seems terrified of true psychological complexity or perversity. It's less a family tragedy than a lousy country dirge.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, Sleepwalking isn’t content being a character study of damaged adult siblings (if it were, it would have made a nice companion piece to Kenneth Lonergan’s "You Can Count on Me," which is a far less sobering, but far more effective, movie).</snippet>

         <snippet>As Mr. Maher, in his feature directing debut, brings in surreal touches and puts on literary airs, the film’s grip loosens, and its vernacular turns increasingly wooden.</snippet>

         <snippet>Theron and Woody Harrelson provide vitality against the film's heavy load, but they aren't around long enough to keep it from collapsing under its own portentous weight.</snippet>
