         <snippet>Anyone who thinks that Josh Hartnett isn't a true movie star should see his riveting, high-wire performance in August.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's not much to it, but Austin Chick's hyper-focused indie does serve as a nicely assured showcase for lead Josh Hartnett.</snippet>

         <snippet>This middling drama has no glaring faults, but simply lacks the intended urgency.</snippet>

         <snippet>Chick's underwhelming exploration of post-millennial angst is as empty and vacant as its protagonist's inexpressive peepers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Another among this year's crop of features that demonstrates that having a cast with indie cred can sometimes do little to buoy a film's miscalculated execution.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's amoral momentum is fatally slowed by an acronym-heavy script and flimsy characterizations that offer fine actors -- including Rip Torn as Tom's contemptuous father and Naomie Harris as his missed opportunity -- little to play.</snippet>

         <snippet>August seems to be missing something essential--a prologue? Or maybe it's not what's missing that's the problem, but what's here.</snippet>

         <snippet>As usual, Hartnett exhibits the acting ability of linoleum; his performance would not be measurably changed if he lapsed into a coma halfway through. Only an amusing cameo by David Bowie enlivens things, but he's onscreen for just about two minutes at the end.</snippet>
