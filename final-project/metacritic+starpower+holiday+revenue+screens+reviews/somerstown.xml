         <snippet>Somers Town, is a trifle: A short black-and-white lark with sharp edges and a soft center. It has its raptures, though, and then some. A disarmingly slight tale of adolescent friendship, Somers Town is one of those rare movies that seems to discover itself as you watch it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is a movie that feels enjoyably aimless--one that invites viewers to just hang out for an hour.</snippet>

         <snippet>A small but important film about small but important lives, the latest drama from Shane Meadows further confirms that more people should know about this gifted director.</snippet>

         <snippet>A funny and endearing character comedy whose extra-brief, 70-minute running time proves perfectly adequate for its slender, episodic story.</snippet>

         <snippet>Meadows in a minor key but still a major delight; his improvised feel, sparky comedy and interest in the truth of youth services a story thatâ€™s both winning and winsome.</snippet>

         <snippet>Meadows and cinematographer Natasha Braier present their story with a gritty, unfussy lyricism that finds unexpected glimpses of beauty in overlooked corners of London.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just when this black-and-white, microbudget movie seems poised to spring an indictment of the Dickensian social order, it ends, but in a redemptive ray of color.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like its star, the movie is too short and a little thin but just about perfect.</snippet>

         <snippet>Basically a comedy but with typically Meadowsian dark edges, it forms an affectionate tribute to cross-cultural friendship and the rapidly changing landscape known as Somers Town.</snippet>

         <snippet>Without ever trivializing his characters' meager circumstances or resorting to the rags-to-riches fantasy of "Slumdog Millionaire," Meadows has made a lovely film about the ability of the imagination to offset the harshness of reality.</snippet>
