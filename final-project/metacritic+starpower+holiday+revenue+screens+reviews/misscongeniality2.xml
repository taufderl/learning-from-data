         <snippet>Isn't exactly good - like "Legally Blonde 2," it's a more exaggerated, less buoyant sequel to what should have been a one-off comedy - but it's enjoyable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Formula sequel right down to its zany subtitle -- Armed and Fabulous. Bullock deserves better. We deserve better. Rev up that '57 Chevy.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the first movie played like a midseason TV pilot, its successor comes off like an extended episode of a generic sitcom.</snippet>

         <snippet>Silly, light fare made better by the over-the-top physical comedy of Bullock and King, but lacking the innate charm of the original.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie awkwardly tries to present Bullock and King as an interracial odd couple. But the overall result is charmless, even insulting.</snippet>
