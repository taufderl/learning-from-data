         <snippet>Watching this interesting, well-acted debut feature from writer-director Russell Brown, one begins to reason that what Nathan and Maggie have in common, besides desire, is a need for a partner who's not completely kind.</snippet>

         <snippet>Race You to the Bottom has an ending that is rightly open yet thoroughly satisfying -- as is the entire film.</snippet>

         <snippet>You want uncomfortable tales of love and woe, then Race You to the Bottom has what you're looking for. And if you believe love is a disease that is meant to send people to screaming, burning hell, then you'll have a laugh riot, a real knee slapper, like 1,000 fart jokes heard all at once.</snippet>

         <snippet>While it does take place over a weekend spent touring Northern California's wine country, writer-director Russell Brown's feature debut isn't exactly a bicurious "Sideways." The characters are less interesting and even less likable, and the only pleasure we can take is in their emotional pain.</snippet>

         <snippet>Although more than a little familiar in its road movie-style romantic banter and bickering, the film is easy to take for a number of reasons, including the witty and frequently caustic dialogue. Modest in its aspirations, "Race You" succeeds by not trying to do too much.</snippet>

         <snippet>These people are so selfish and self-absorbed you may not want to spent even 72 minutes with them.</snippet>

         <snippet>Self-consciously edgy and romantically limp.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a bad heterosexual date movie (more a date-gone-wrong), has too limited a gay angle for that demographic, and is about characters who are not particularly likable as individuals or as a couple.</snippet>
