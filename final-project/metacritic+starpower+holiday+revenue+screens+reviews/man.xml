         <snippet>Who knew Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy would make such a dynamic comic duo?</snippet>

         <snippet>An action buddy comedy is such an offbeat and inspired notion that it's impossible not to think of it without smiling.</snippet>

         <snippet>Levy and Jackson save the day, and the film. The Man isn't great entertainment, but it contains enough laughter-provoking material to make it worth a look.</snippet>

         <snippet>Functional if thoroughly uninspired movie. Because it clings to the comedy-action template of "48 Hrs.," pic feels like it could have been made 15 years ago.</snippet>

         <snippet>Both Jackson and Levy are better than director Les Mayfield's ("Blue Streak") meandering comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>While nothing in the movie - least of all the two main performances - is especially fresh or original, it does have a few decent gags and amusing moments.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's the kind of featherweight slot-filler people turn off after 15 minutes on a plane or have on in the background on cable while they vacuum the floor.</snippet>

         <snippet>The only characters in this formulaic crime comedy that I halfway liked were a couple of barely glimpsed wives, but the two leads keep it going through sheer determination.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jackson and Levy strike only damp sparks off each other, and they seem to have been introduced to each other --without benefit of rehearsal -- mere moments before the director cried "Action!"</snippet>

         <snippet>Nobody needed to make it, nobody needs to see it, Jackson and Levy are too successful to waste time with it. It plays less like a film than like a deal.</snippet>

         <snippet>The screenplay has no idea how to modulate the banter between the movie's talented stars so that it approximates affectionate and playful sparring.</snippet>

         <snippet>Most of The Man is as awful as last year's debacle, "Taxi," yet Levy, stuck in a no-brainer variation on Billy Crystal's predicament in "Analyze This," shows just enough noodgy passive-aggression to suggest what the movie might have been were it not shackled to buddy-action clich√©s.</snippet>

         <snippet>Less a movie than a longform, live-action Celebrity Death Match between its leads, this wheezing comedy may herald the death knell of the interracial buddy-cop farce.</snippet>

         <snippet>Arrives in theaters today with a sheet over its head and a tag on its toe. So to speak. What we have here is a complete systemic failure, a comedy that's not funny, with action that's not thrilling.</snippet>
