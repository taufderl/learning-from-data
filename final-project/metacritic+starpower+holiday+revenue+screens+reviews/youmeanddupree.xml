         <snippet>You, Me And Dupree isn't terribly democratic about spreading the laughs around; whenever Wilson disappears from the screen, the comedy evaporates in kind.</snippet>

         <snippet>Isn't a very funny movie (it preaches nonconformity in the rote style of an overlit sitcom), but Wilson, at least, keeps it afloat.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like Dupree himself, the film wears out its welcome a little, but is still entertaining.</snippet>

         <snippet>Though it is not nearly as funny as last summer's "Wedding Crashers," directing brothers Joe and Anthony Russo's You, Me and Dupree has plenty of chuckles and another sparkling, post-adolescent surfer-dude performance from Owen Wilson.</snippet>

         <snippet>Occasionally clicks into full-speed farce mode, but never for long - or for long enough.</snippet>

         <snippet>Owen Wilson single-handedly hauls this amiable, middle-of-the-road comedy out of sheer mediocrity.</snippet>

         <snippet>A middling third-wheel comedy elevated a couple of notches by the ineffably weird charms of Owen Wilson.</snippet>

         <snippet>The comedy is obvious and flat while the drama is stale. They did do one thing right, however: They attracted a stellar cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mess of conflicting tones and missed opportunities. The only one to emerge unscathed is Kate Hudson, who exhibits qualities she has rarely shown since her breakthrough role in "Almost Famous."</snippet>

         <snippet>I don't mean to imply that this film is any good or that it contains an ounce of genuine insight. But as a template for the big-baby genre, it's invaluable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Doesn't aspire to be much more than a serviceable summer comedy, and the script displays the engineered precision of a theme park ride.</snippet>

         <snippet>Working with a shapeless script, directors Anthony and Joe Russo (Welcome to Collinwood) can't figure out what they're making. They lunge in several directions, but fail to get around the central problem: most of their actors have little flair for comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>When the film is not focused on Wilson, it's really not focused at all. This is a comedy ever holding itself in check, filled with plot threads and asides that seem as though they should be funny but almost always fall short of the mark.</snippet>

         <snippet>A limp attempt to wed a romantic comedy to a buddy comedy, largely because the filmmakers see women as visitors from another planet, which is more or less what they now are in Hollywood.</snippet>

         <snippet>Something about Wilson is just so comfortable, so loose, that he can make the most pointless movie seem, by moments, as if it deserves to exist. But even the presence of the Butterscotch Stallion can't sweeten this bland compendium of rom-com clich√©s.</snippet>

         <snippet>Artistically, You, Me and Dupree is a mess. Technically, it's an abomination. Spiritually, it's a void. Commercially, it'll probably be a big hit.</snippet>
