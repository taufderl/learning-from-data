         <snippet>The kind of drama that British television used to do so well, a well-constructed, smartly observed story of ordinary people learning how to communicate with one another.</snippet>

         <snippet>Dellal and their cast consistently hit the right notes, and the result is an uplifting tale that you don't have to be embarrassed to enjoy.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mullan is a great choice as Frank, playing the silent guy with all kinds of baggage perfectly.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mullan makes the journey more than worthwhile, but don't go in expecting profundity.</snippet>

         <snippet>Humorous touches add warmth without being cloying, but Mullan carries the film with his intelligence and rugged intensity: images of his barrel-chested physique against the craggy shore resound on such an elemental level as to be almost spiritual.</snippet>

         <snippet>Sweet-natured, if somewhat familiar, On a Clear Day features fine performances by Mullan, Blethyn and Sives. Dellal and cinematographer David Johnson paint an inviting picture of Glasgow.</snippet>

         <snippet>By turns whimsically humorous and intelligently sentimental, but also infused with a pungent air of working-class realism.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite a familiar crop of lovable eccentrics and a predictably inspirational thrust, the movie resists formula just enough to achieve a surprising degree of emotional traction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Against all reason, this workingman's journey across the sea winds up seeming every bit as inspirational as the filmmakers intended, entirely because Mullan's grit validates every cornpone emotion. With a lesser actor, the movie would sink like a stone.</snippet>

         <snippet>Didn't we just see this movie? Over in Britain, big bad governments may be outsourcing his job and rendering him redundant, but never fear -- the plucky working-class hero has definitely found a steady gig on the silver screen.</snippet>

         <snippet>While On a Clear Day can claim both a surplus of heart and adequate brains, it comes up lacking in the courage department.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just as surely as the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, this domestic comedy follows a direct path through every crisis, every resolution and every sentimental heartbeat laid out in the script.</snippet>

         <snippet>Scottish actor Peter Mullan saves a drama tangled in the seaweed of life lessons from drowning in pathos.</snippet>

         <snippet>On a Clear Day is in most respects "The Full Monty," only with swimming, not stripping, and no bursts into song or dance - only the usual canny sequencing of tears and laughter, interspersed here with fetching underwater photography and father-son issues up the wazoo.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Gaby Dellal's cynically mushy film, like "The Full Monty" and its ilk, is best savored only by its target demo: middle-classers who see one imported film a year, the selection in question requiring working-stiff melodrama and leprechaun burrs gently and lovably mangling the English dialogue.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>It's a first feature film for both screenwriter Alex Rose and director Gaby Dellal, and their inexperience shows in Frank's underdeveloped relationships with family and friends and in the movie's sluggish pacing.</snippet>
