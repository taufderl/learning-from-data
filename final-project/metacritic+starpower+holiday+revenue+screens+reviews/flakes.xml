         <snippet>While Stanford is more annoying than endearing as the self-righteous slacker, the charming Deschanel provides the film with its few moments of genuine fun with her offbeat turn as the wily, put-upon girlfriend.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite a few good one-liners, the dialogue is overwritten, and director Michael Lehmann (Heathers, The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs) is in thrall with the hipness he tries to chronicle.</snippet>

         <snippet>A business course on cutthroat capitalism disguised as a slacker comedy: That’s the kindest way to describe Michael Lehmann’s Flakes.</snippet>

         <snippet>There are a few sweet moments as the story reaches its unsurprising conclusion. But, all in all, Flakes isn't going to bowl you over.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unless you happen to be one yourself, chances are pretty good that you'll take an immediate dislike to the self-satisfied hipsters who populate this disappointing comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The characters Lehmann and company use as generational mouthpieces bear no relation to any people who have ever existed, and they barely work as parody.</snippet>
