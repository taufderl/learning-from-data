         <snippet>That may not exactly thrill those who admire the Saw films only for their splatter quotient, but all told, this is a more affecting study in grief, guilt and human frailty than "Babel."</snippet>

         <snippet>Admit it: It's not every horror film that can make you feel preached at and slimed at the same time.</snippet>

         <snippet>While Saw III provides a decent number of new twists, psychological as well as torture-wise, it necessarily lacks the originality of its predecessors.</snippet>

         <snippet>An improvement over the tedious "Saw II" (2005), this second sequel to the surprise 2004 hit still features the series' trademark gruesome "games" but shifts the focus to the relationships among the characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>The question for moviegoers: Would you rather get your dose of existenz-philosophie from Dostoyevsky or a slasher flick?</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike the disturbingly mysterious original, Saw III is a neatly wrapped-up package that explains everything -- including Jigsaw's evil contraptions and the background of his crazed female assistant.</snippet>

         <snippet>Bottom line, those in the "Saw" factory know their audience and have brought along the appropriate buckets and bibs. Even devotees, however, may note pacing problems and tire of Jigsaw's selective omnipotence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Saw III may be the best of the trilogy; hopefully, it'll encourage its makers to wrap the franchise on a relatively high note.</snippet>

         <snippet>As much as you'd like the characters to become better people and beat Jigsaw's game, there is also a strong desire simply to watch violent spectacle. And somehow, there just isn't enough of the latter.</snippet>

         <snippet>The presence of some genuine feeling distinguishes Saw III from its predecessors. That said, it has plenty of the blood, torture and dismemberment that moviegoers demand from their Halloween weekend entertainment.</snippet>

         <snippet>The most depressing thing about this series is not the creativity of the bloodletting but the bleak view of human nature.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just like its increasingly wan antihero, this blood-soaked series is on its last legs.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is laughably absurd, but unlike the first "Saw," the third installment gives no indication that its humor is intentional.</snippet>

         <snippet>While "Saw" and "Saw II" were pretty good splatter films hampered by spectacularly unbelievable endings, Saw III is annoying for almost the duration of the movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Television is a state of mind. And the makers of Saw III have delivered the most despicable episode of "One Life to Live" ever.</snippet>
