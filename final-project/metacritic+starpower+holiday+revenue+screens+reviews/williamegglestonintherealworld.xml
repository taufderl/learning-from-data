         <snippet>Filmmaker Michael Almereyda gives the most persuasive possible account of the upswing in Eggleston's critical standing.</snippet>

         <snippet>Almereyda has crafted an uncannily revealing portrait of a major American artist at work, all the more remarkable for the deceptive casualness with which it unfolds, as if Almereyda had just shown up.</snippet>

         <snippet>An elegantly discursive examination of one of the great modern photographers, a surprisingly intimate portrait of an elusive, laconic man.</snippet>

         <snippet>Mr. Eggleston proves the polished granddaddy who, early on, recognized beauty in a garish wasteland. In this accomplished look at a storied career, he instructs - without words - how to see all that is hauntingly familiar.</snippet>

         <snippet>Eggleston doesn't speak much, and when he does, it's usually a mutter, forcing Almereyda to use subtitles. Fortunately, Eggleston's photographs come across loud and clear.</snippet>

         <snippet>The documentary is elliptical, with a slow, drifty rhythm. It presents an up-close but impersonal view of Eggleston.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result isn't particularly mesmerizing, but it does offer a well-rounded portrait that will be of particular interest to photography lovers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Without slavishly imitating the photographer's distinctive style, Almereyda also manages to connect his own images to all that's "Egglestonian" in the photographer's world.</snippet>

         <snippet>The trouble with artists making documentaries about other artists is that art tends to get in the way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite Almereyda's strong following in arthouse circles, William Eggleston in the Real World --which requires patient if not repeat viewing -- will probably not venture far into it.</snippet>
