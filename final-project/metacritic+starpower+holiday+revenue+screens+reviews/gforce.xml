         <snippet>A pleasant, inoffensive 3-D animated farce about a team of superspy gophers.</snippet>

         <snippet>Thanks to an unexpected twist and a clever motivation lurking in the back story of the super-villain, G-Force has enough going on to more or less maintain grown-up interest, and there's plenty to please the kiddies.</snippet>

         <snippet>Amping up the "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" formula with a whole A-team of adorable, talking furballs who converse in one-liners and pop culture references (Apocalypse Now and Scarface, really?), the mega-producer’s stamp is on every fight sequence, explosion and ugly stereotype.</snippet>

         <snippet>Your ability to enjoy G-Force will correlate directly with how funny you find the idea of guinea pigs as action heroes.</snippet>

         <snippet>The first 3-D film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer turns out to be similar to 2-D projects from the same noise-making producer--heavy on action scenes and heavy, too, on message.</snippet>

         <snippet>G-Force is unlikely to keep anyone older than 10 on the edge of his seat, and the bathroom humor may annoy adults. But the message of unity, while unoriginal, is consistently sweet.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's an action-comedy. It's in 3-D. There's a video-game tie-in. Throw in a fluorescent Slushie from the candy counter and your eight-year-old will be in heaven.</snippet>

         <snippet>Manages to be fairly entertaining in that exhausting, rackety, late-summer-kiddie-movie way.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just about the only folks likely to find this humdrum hybrid of "Mission: Impossible" and "The Wind in the Willows" worthy for consideration are non-discriminating pip-squeaks.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's seldom a dull moment -- but nor are there any that allow viewers young or old to invest in its elite team of furry characters to any satisfying or lasting degree despite the presence of an energetic voice cast.</snippet>

         <snippet>Toward the end, G-Force starts making no sense at all, neither tonally or narratively. It may not matter to the target audience, though the look on my son's face when it was over was pure Buster Keaton. He says he liked it well enough. Me, a little less.</snippet>

         <snippet>A fur-covered "A-Team" for the kiddies, G-Force is heavy on splashy pyrotechnics and predictably light on plot.</snippet>

         <snippet>Pointing out G-Force’s plot holes would be redundant; it’s more hole than plot, and more videogame commercial and exhausted-old-trope clearinghouse than film.</snippet>

         <snippet>What it is, really, is a trainer film, meant to prep the world's youngest ticketholders for the day when they're old enough to help turn Bruckheimer's bigger movies into blockbusters.</snippet>

         <snippet>A lot of resources went into making G-Force - a lot of talent, a lot of money, a lot of marketing - and there's not much to show for it, not even some halfway imaginative 3-D gimmickry.</snippet>
