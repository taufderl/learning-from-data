         <snippet>The cast sparkles especially Simon Baker, a sturdy leading-man type, who is primed to break through any day now, and Paz Vega, already a star in Latin market.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite teasing hints of supernatural influences throughout much of the storyline, Not Forgotten satisfies as a solidly crafted and persuasively acted thriller that relies more on dark secrets than black magic.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film moves swiftly and vividly, but in retrospect, numerous plot holes come to mind. Not Forgotten presents a fascinating microcosm but ultimately loses believability when placed in a larger context.</snippet>

         <snippet>A lurid yet plodding thriller, bobs to the surface in theaters, most likely to the chagrin of the now very hot Simon Baker.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the film's first two-thirds are dreary and preposterous, give Soref credit for a truly -- what's the proper cinematic terminology? -- batshit-crazy finale involving demented religious sects, ridiculously bloody face-offs and a gaggle of cross-dressing Mexican prostitutes.</snippet>

         <snippet>A film that could have been memorably haunting is, sadly, all too forgettable</snippet>

         <snippet>None of it makes any sense, but it is just nutty enough to provide a few (entirely unintended) laughs.</snippet>
