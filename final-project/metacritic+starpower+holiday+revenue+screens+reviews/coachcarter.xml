         <snippet>This entry in a rather stale genre deserves to be put at the head of the class.</snippet>

         <snippet>Descended from a long and healthy line of high school-sports and academic-achievement films, a hip-hop "Hoosiers" bolstered by a generous helping of "Stand and Deliver" and "Lean On Me."</snippet>

         <snippet>A sports flick that’s a worthy addition to the genre.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jackson has the usual big speeches assigned to all coaches in all sports movies, and delivers on them, big time. His passion makes familiar scenes feel new.</snippet>

         <snippet>A true story, feel-good parable and a respectable, uplifting descendent of "To Sir, With Love" and "Lean On Me."</snippet>

         <snippet>It's fair to say that Coach Carter is more an education film than it is a sports movie.</snippet>

         <snippet>Covers every cliche in the Hollywood sports movie playbook, but it also makes the routine much more enjoyable than you'd expect.</snippet>

         <snippet>Both an inspirational sports movie and an unexpected multi-level urban drama that plays by its own clock.</snippet>

         <snippet>Coach Carter, its flaws aside, is as interesting for what it doesn't do as for what it does.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jackson's wonderfully nuanced, witty performance, and a few unexpected plot turns, give Coach Carter a subtext that helps complicate such knee-jerk oversimplifications, redeeming the role with energetic humor and a loose-limbed grace.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the movie may border on teen exploitation in many scenes, its heart and values are mostly in the right place, and it qualifies its thrill of victory with a very sober message: few high school athletes become NBA millionaires, many are cheated out of an education.</snippet>

         <snippet>Who's it for? How do you put this message across without it seeming medicinal? Sure, MTV is among the movie's producers, but what 11th grader wants to spend a Friday night being hit with such a blunt instrument?</snippet>

         <snippet>When [Jackcson]'s not on camera, Coach Carter feels like the two-hour opus it is — too long, too banal, a bit ridiculous. But when he is, nothing else seems to matter, and how sublime is that.</snippet>

         <snippet>This may be the coach's story, but to the extent that Coach Carter is interesting rather than merely inspirational, it's because of the team.</snippet>

         <snippet>A smart entertainment that trades on Mr. Jackson's forceful presence, a cast of extremely likable young actors and lots of basketball action.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director Thomas Carter (no relation to Ken) relies on processed emotion and stock characters, and not even the inevitable Big Game excites us very much.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie's moral messages are all on target. Too bad the movie is much, much too long and Jackson gives one of his dullest performances ever.</snippet>

         <snippet>Coach Carter eventually curdles into a grim love letter to discipline and accountability, which makes it the perfect sports film for W.'s second term, but not a whole lot of fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>So, while the movie at times warmed my own middle-class, private school-educated cockles to a toasty complacency, there's an undercurrent of friendly fascism running through it like a nasty draft.</snippet>

         <snippet>2-1/4 hours of MTV-produced tough love, with a dance break and pool party to relieve -- momentarily -- a series of motivational rants from lead Samuel L. Jackson.</snippet>

         <snippet>As it goes on and on and on, Coach Carter becomes more patience-testing than soul-stirring, proving that you can overdose on good intentions as easily as you can on evil substances.</snippet>
