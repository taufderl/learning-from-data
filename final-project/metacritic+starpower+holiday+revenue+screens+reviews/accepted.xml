         <snippet>It's one of the few genuinely funny comedies in a dismal movie summer.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you can lighten up for an hour and a half, the film delivers one good laugh after another.</snippet>

         <snippet>Low of brow and pure of heart, the movie plays like "Animal House" extra-lite, and as such it's decent indecent fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>How much you join in will depend on how big a fan you are of the collegiate comedy formula, how many times you've seen "Animal House" and "Caddyshack," and how much you hate Long in those smarmy Mac commercials.</snippet>

         <snippet>An absurd little trifle, but it does have a kind of buoyant, punky energy.</snippet>

         <snippet>After a very funny start, there just isn't enough content to fill the feature-length curriculum.</snippet>

         <snippet>Accepted is an inspired premise in search of a movie: What starts out as a scabrous takedown of academic bureaucracy ends up yet another modestly rousing underdog story about the little slacker that could.</snippet>

         <snippet>The ideal viewer of Accepted probably won't have seen any college comedies before. Or any slobs-vs.-snobs movies like "Caddyshack." For those who have, it's kind of a snore.</snippet>

         <snippet>One could argue that you shouldn't expect a teen comedy to offer a nuanced depiction of the role of education in public life, but in response I'd refer you to "Election" and "Clueless."</snippet>

         <snippet>Accepted will make for a passable alternative to sold-out shows of "Snakes on a Plane," but it's a disappointing debut for the director Steve Pink.</snippet>

         <snippet>A mildly funny PG-13 effort that is just dying to release an R- or unrated DVD version of itself. That way all the pool party sequences can lay off the false modesty.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like its underachieving protagonist, Steve Pink's teen comedy Accepted flashes just enough charm to get by but is too lazy to really make anything of itself.</snippet>

         <snippet>Paradoxically fast-talking and laid back, Long's Bartleby appears to be the illegitimate child of Groucho Marx and Ferris Bueller, one whose schemes are far more impressive than his deeds.</snippet>

         <snippet>Has neither the raucous energy and impudence of "Animal House," the defiance of "If ...," nor the grace and wit of "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle."</snippet>

         <snippet>Take the cast of 1978's "Animal House" and 1984's "Revenge of the Nerds," toss them on a desert island, watch them breed and enroll their raucous, kvetching offspring at a college for rejects. A fluffy teen comedy, Accepted gets annoying fast.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's an obvious nod to "Rock 'n' Roll High School" that mostly serves as a grim reminder of how far comedies about the education system have fallen.</snippet>

         <snippet>A campus comedy that's as dull as bong water, Accepted is like the product of a community college filmmaking class, remedial division.</snippet>
