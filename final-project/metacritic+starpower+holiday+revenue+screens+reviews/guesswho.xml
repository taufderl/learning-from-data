         <snippet>The movie's sweetness, wit and charm go beyond its can't-we-all-just-get-along premise.</snippet>

         <snippet>Surprise! After a clumsy opening, Guess Who goes down very smoothly. Its cast is appealing, its script is often clever and imaginative.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the movie had spent more time walking that tightrope between the acceptable and the offensive, between what we have in common and what divides us, it would have been more daring.</snippet>

         <snippet>Might provide a much-needed fix for Mac's most ardent fans, but they'll have to wait for a star vehicle that fully exploits the range of his comic gifts.</snippet>

         <snippet>To say it's better than it has any right to be gives the original too much credit and the remake not enough.</snippet>

         <snippet>Guess Who, with its PG-13 putdowns, turns into the kind of love story that Hollywood feels most comfortable with: a buddy movie, salt-and-pepper variety. All that's missing is the cop car.</snippet>

         <snippet>The verdict? Could have been worse. Yes, it's a slightly hollow endorsement, but Guess Who is probably worth your matinee/pub-theater dollar.</snippet>

         <snippet>So mild and thin that it doesn't inspire much of a reaction at all. With one exception - a dinner table scene that is by far the most memorable in the movie - the racial humor is studiously unprovocative.</snippet>
