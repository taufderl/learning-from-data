         <snippet>A film of wonderful looseness and innovation. Set free to film fakes, the director is the real thing.</snippet>

         <snippet>With rich irony, The World juxtaposes the teasing, grand images of the outside world's wonders with the insular community and the mundane lives of the park employees.</snippet>

         <snippet>A movie with the visual expanse of a John Ford western and the ensemble grandeur and long takes of a Robert Altman picture. The movie is definitely Chinese in content, but it exudes American style and spirit.</snippet>

         <snippet>The title of Jia Zhang-ke's 2004 masterpiece, The World -- a film that's hilarious and upsetting, epic and dystopian -- is an ironic pun and a metaphor.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jia's compassion for the drifting souls struggling to create a life for themselves in such a transitory existence makes the metaphor resonant.</snippet>

         <snippet>On a first viewing, the movie seemed a dilution of the formal strategies Jia had perfected-at once less dispassionate and less empathetic. After a repeat viewing, it still strikes me as Jia's fourth-best film (that it's one of the year's best says plenty about the level at which he's working), but it's more apparent that The Worl d's muffled emotional impact should be understood as a function of its setting.</snippet>

         <snippet>Maverick Chinese director Jia Zhangke examines the rapidly changing face of China as its economy edges further toward a modified form of market capitalism with yet another complex, multicharacter masterpiece.</snippet>

         <snippet>While the film feels overlong at two hours 20 minutes, there's a seductive stillness to its enveloping mood.</snippet>

         <snippet>Loosely constructed, The World drifts along pleasantly for much of its two-and-a-half-hour running time. Mr. Jia has a terrific eye and an almost sculptural sense of film space (especially in close quarters), and he brings texture and density to even the most nondescript rooms.</snippet>

         <snippet>Jia's message is that globalization has failed to help the Chinese masses. We hear you, dude, but did you really need 143 minutes to get your point across?</snippet>

         <snippet>The World has a pokey pace, but it presents a uniquely powerful look at the new big kid in the global economy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The World's dull weave of frustrated romances and worker exploitation is far too obvious, and Jia can only relieve the tedium so many times.</snippet>
