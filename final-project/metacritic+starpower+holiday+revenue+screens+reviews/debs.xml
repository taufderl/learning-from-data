         <snippet>Splashed and accessorized with brainy nonsense, "D.E.B.S." is a "H.O.O.T."</snippet>

         <snippet>So what started as a female "Agent Cody Banks" happily and seamlessly becomes so much more, with style and substance existing in unusual harmony for a spy spoof.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cute, campy and as proudly insubstantial as its heroines' micro-miniskirts, D.E.B.S. deftly fulfills its Jane Bond fantasies without so much as breaking a nail.</snippet>

         <snippet>The terrific soundtrack, which includes the Only Ones' "Another Girl, Another Planet" and New Order's most excellent "Temptation," is heavily weighted towards the '80s, which is exactly as it should be.</snippet>

         <snippet>For an unabashedly silly spoof of a girly action flick, D.E.B.S. is unexpectedly fresh, thanks mostly to the sweetly exuberant love story at its center.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's so spoofy it's difficult to call 'good' or even 'bad'; just say it's smooth.</snippet>

         <snippet>The most endearing aspect of D.E.B.S., a sweet-spirited spoof, is that the lesbian romance is played for real, with no nudge-nudge wink-wink irony.</snippet>

         <snippet>Alas, the movie isn't nearly as amusing as its premise, but it's refreshingly different from most run-of-the-mill teenage fare.</snippet>

         <snippet>This forced spoof seems to be targeted at lesbian couples and hetero men with severe schoolgirl fetishes; that may be a legitimate market, but I'd hate to be sitting between them.</snippet>

         <snippet>An incorrigible tease. It baits its audience with the promise of fluffy, light-footed cotton-candy fare, but delivers a clumsy, talky, indifferently filmed lesbian romance.</snippet>

         <snippet>At some point during the pitch meetings for D.E.B.S. someone must certainly have used the words "Charlie's Lesbians."</snippet>

         <snippet>You might think there's no downside to a movie that peeks up the skirts of babes in micro-minis, but writer-director Angela Robinson's dimwitted satire is libido-killing proof to the contrary.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film has no idea of how to develop its one-joke premise. The tepid love scenes are as erotically charged as a home movie of a little girl hugging her Barbie doll, and the satire as cutting as the blunt edge of a plastic butter knife.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie has no wit, no charm, no cleverness, no traction. Simply put, it is no fun.</snippet>
