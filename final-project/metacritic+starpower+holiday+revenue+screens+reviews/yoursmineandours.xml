         <snippet>Unable to decide whether it wants to be a rambunctious family comedy or a tender romantic comedy, the Dennis Quaid-Rene Russo vehicle strains to be both and ends up falling short of both marks.</snippet>

         <snippet>The storyline is so familiar ("Cheaper by the Dozen," et al), the audience can practically call out scenes ahead of time.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie, directed with a gym teacher's whistle by "Scooby-Doo's" Raja Gosnell, is a contempo soft-focus remake of the 1968 original starring Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda.</snippet>

         <snippet>So snug, airtight and insulated from reality that the nice, well-scrubbed "Cheaper by the Dozen" seems almost rambunctious by comparison.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie equivalent of a box of generic macaroni and cheese: bland, easily digested, comforting, forgettable.</snippet>

         <snippet>The remake seems to have been written and directed by people whose only experience with children is the long-distant memory of having been kids themselves so many years ago.</snippet>

         <snippet>Synthetic, strained and noisy, Yours, Mine &amp; Ours is a clinker that doesn't bear comparison with the original. Quaid, Russo and others deserve better.</snippet>

         <snippet>The humor is supposed to stem from the clash of kids who have been raised so differently and of partners with opposing views of child care. But there are just so many jokes you can make about who gets to use the bathroom when.</snippet>

         <snippet>This wretched remake was helmed by Raja Gosnell, perpetrator of the live-action "Scooby-Doo" movies. I'm partial to Quaid and Russo, but there are limits.</snippet>

         <snippet>The kind of film that will be suitable for all-ages entertainment once the family runs out of conversation after devouring all the turkey, but it's unlikely to expand its audience beyond these captives.</snippet>
