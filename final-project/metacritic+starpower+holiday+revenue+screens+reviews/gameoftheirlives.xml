         <snippet>What the cast members lack in sharpened skill they more than make up for in raw gusto and athletic scrappiness (most of the actors have logged a lot of soccer in their pasts). These guys give a sport that is virtually nameless in the movies a good name in this one.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unlike some other soccer movies, there's no fancy editing -- excitement is generated strictly by the actual choreography and the commentary of an English announcer.</snippet>

         <snippet>Coaching from the same playbook with which they made "Rudy" and "Hoosiers," director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo create a reverent fable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite strong performances by Gerard Butler and Wes Bentley as the leaders of the two factions and crisply directed soccer action, the movie lacks a powerful central presence to carry the drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>But Game really isn't a performer's movie. And the climactic contest (in which the Americans amazingly eked out a 1-0 win against England, considered by many to be the world's finest team at the time) is only serviceably staged.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Game of Their Lives has a great sports story to tell, yet the filmmakers fumble it away.</snippet>

         <snippet>The final match stirs briefly, but when it's over, the movie's energy crashes right back down again. Disappointing.</snippet>

         <snippet>By the time of the fabled match -- which you could swear lasts a full 90 minutes -- it's all you can do to keep your skin from crawling off your body and slinking to the safety of another room. Do yourself a favor: Follow it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Picturesque pic, however, lacks even a penalty kick's worth of tension and is paradoxically inert for a movie about guys running up and down the pitch for the glory of the U.S.</snippet>

         <snippet>Obviously made with all of the best will in the world, its heart in the right place, this is a sluggish and dutiful film that plays more like a eulogy than an adventure.</snippet>

         <snippet>It is flat-footed, uninspired and disjointed from start to finish, a glaring disservice to the men who played the game.</snippet>
