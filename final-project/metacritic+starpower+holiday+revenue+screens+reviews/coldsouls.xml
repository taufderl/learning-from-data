         <snippet>Darkly funny, twisty-cool existential tragicomedy, loaded with smart notions and filmed like a surrealist dream.</snippet>

         <snippet>Barthes takes her notion and runs with it, and Giamatti and Strathairn follow fearlessly.</snippet>

         <snippet>Paul Giamatti - that huddle of broiling instincts, out-of-control impulses and aggravated ardor epitomized in "Sideways" - you feel his soul's absence as dearly as its presence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Anchored by a great Giamatti performance, Cold Souls is built around a terrific idea and has serious fun with it. It also marks Barthes as a filmmaker to watch.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cold Souls has its flaws, and it threatens to sag into a Paul-like morbidity, but Giamatti’s anxious mien and unspectacular shamblings have never been better deployed.</snippet>

         <snippet>The low-key satire would have benefited from more of a back story to Giamatti's character and a clearer sense of his relationship with his wife. But what we do get is compelling in the way of an indelible, dreamy short story.</snippet>

         <snippet>He's (Giamatti) terrific throughout, although the movie, which is more clever than funny, sometimes resembles second-tier Charlie Kaufman stuff.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie turns what could have been a tedious meta-movie exercise into a sincere dour farce.</snippet>

         <snippet>Cold Souls entertains on its own terms, delivering irony and suspense as Giamatti discovers that his soulless self is a terrible, terrible actor.</snippet>

         <snippet>In this attractive, smart-enough, finally un-brave movie Ms. Barthes peeks at the dark comedy of the soul only to beat a quick, pre-emptive retreat.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Works precisely because its ambitions are somewhat mellow; this isn't a relentlessly high-strung picture. Barthes and Giamatti do more with less, turning the idea of excessive navel-gazing into a kind of game.</snippet>

         <snippet>Somewhere between the rabbit-hole absurdist comedy of Charlie Kaufman and a navel-gazing Woody Allen film is the somberly humorous indie Cold Souls.</snippet>

         <snippet>It may be only in the film's last ambiguous, evocative image that Barthes and Parekh finally transcend the material and arrive at something beautiful and ineffable.</snippet>

         <snippet>Giamatti is aptly cast, playing his own persona with awkward anxiety and suitably skewed humor.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>An amusing slice of existential whimsy with an Eastern European bent, Cold Souls posits a world in which humans can have their souls extracted and implanted in each others’ bodies.</snippet>

         <snippet>The premise seems profound, but the claustrophobically inert execution lacks reach or imagination.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>The movie still works as a clever little "Twilight Zone" episode with great production values, and it's an impressively ambitious debut for Barthes.</snippet>

         <snippet>Giamatti tries very hard to put over Cold Souls -- some of his reaction shots are priceless -- but it's going to leave some people, well, cold.</snippet>

         <snippet>Paul Giamatti plays himself in a dark indie comedy that's distinguished by a sci-fi theme and surrealistic touches but ends without a payoff.</snippet>
