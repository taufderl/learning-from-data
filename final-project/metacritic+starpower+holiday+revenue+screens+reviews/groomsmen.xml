         <snippet>As a writer-director, Edward Burns is as industrious as an occupational therapist. He makes sure each of his people is well positioned for happiness.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Groomsmen captures a single, specific moment, when responsibilities await but adulthood is still unwelcome. If their predicament strikes a chord, you may want to join Burns' boys for their final hurrah.</snippet>

         <snippet>The Groomsmen, while as corny as a Staten Island marriage proposal, rings true on many levels.</snippet>

         <snippet>This is like any other Edward Burns film, except for one thing. It's unmistakably better. This is the movie I believe Burns has been trying to make since "The Brothers McMullen," 11 years ago.</snippet>

         <snippet>Leguizamo deserves real kudos for making what he does of T.C., who is the film's walking lesson in how to undermine elitist clich√©s about working-class Long Island.</snippet>

         <snippet>Burns' always impressive sense of place lends authenticity to the pals' perambulations, and the stellar cast brings a welcome overabundance of personality to regrettably one-note roles.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie snaps sharply to life every now and then, and its unfashionable decency really gets to you.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fatally conventional in nearly every respect, the movie would be easy to dismiss were it not for Burns's frustrating knack for inserting unexpectedly truthful moments amid all the dross.</snippet>

         <snippet>The biggest hole in a movie that falls sadly short of being another "Diner" or "Trees Lounge" is Mr. Burns's failure to make his alter-ego character anything other than the best-looking and most affluent member of the pack, standing there and discreetly gloating.</snippet>
