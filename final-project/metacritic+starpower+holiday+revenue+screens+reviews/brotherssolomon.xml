         <snippet>A better film would have matched Arnett's seemingly effortless intensity throughout. This okay film does merely okay by it.</snippet>

         <snippet>The sheer, animal idiocy beaming from their faces in the opening credits of The Brothers Solomon creates the film's only moment of uncalculated comic joy.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie doesn't have much visual style or atmosphere, but it does have a kinder, gentler spirit than many gross-out comedies, and that makes it a likable time killer.</snippet>

         <snippet>There's nothing very wise about The Brothers Solomon. It's a moderately funny premise in search of some real laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>This new goof might have been funnier still if the premise weren't so derivative, so just been there, done that.</snippet>

         <snippet>The stoy makes no sense, and the two lead characters are repulsive, but I must confess I laughed immoderately at this clever piece of junk.</snippet>

         <snippet>A syrupy fable about love and family? What happened? Did they lose their nerves? Or did some meddling studio executive pull them back before they went too far out on a limb? The comedy gods hate a coward, so let’s hope it’s the latter.</snippet>

         <snippet>About the best thing that can be said about The Brothers Solomon is that it's harmless. It's mild, familiar, and as inconsequential as a sitcom episode.</snippet>

         <snippet>If anyone is to blame for this bomb it's Forte: He wrote the thing, and one would assume he's the one responsible for those uncomfortable silences where jokes are supposed to be.</snippet>

         <snippet>The upbeat brothers are full of sweetness and love, but the script is made of taffy, and if you can chew and laugh at the same time, you're welcome to it.</snippet>

         <snippet>A deranged, sometimes desperate parody of an inspirational losers-make-good comedy. Three gags miss for every one that hits.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is nothing sadder, either in real life or on the movie screen, than an unlikable idiot, and what we have with this dreadful comedy -- the longest 90 minutes of the film year -- is the sight of not one but two charm-free fools.</snippet>

         <snippet>There is no getting these boys down. They are just like Lloyd and Harry in the Farrelly brothers' breakthrough 1994 hit, "Dumb &amp; Dumber." Except that they are never, ever funny.</snippet>

         <snippet>Excruciatingly acted and ineptly directed by Bob Odenkirk, The Brothers Solomon is faux Farrelly brothers that should have gone straight to video.</snippet>
