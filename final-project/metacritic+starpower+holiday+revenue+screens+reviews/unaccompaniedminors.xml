         <snippet>It may not advance the art form, but it's a movie with pleasures for the whole family, and nowadays that's saying something.</snippet>

         <snippet>When it works, it's decent family fun; the kids are incredibly sharp. But the script's not as sharp as they are, and not everyone brings his A-game.</snippet>

         <snippet>Crashes the slapstick of "Home Alone" into the youthful angst of "The Breakfast Club."</snippet>

         <snippet>There isn't an original moment in the mix, but it's not as crass or vulgar as much of what passes for "family friendly" entertainment, and it keeps the precocious pop-culture references to a blessed minimum.</snippet>

         <snippet>Feig does wring out a few fleeting fun/heartfelt moments from the minors, and the movie's Christmas treacle is smoother than "Santa Clause 3's." But anyone old enough to go see this without a parent or guardian will have seen it all before.</snippet>

         <snippet>Black's apoplectic fits and sardonic rants are strictly a bonus for the parents dragged along for the adolescent shenanigans.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is too busy hurling its cast from one labored slapstick setpiece to another to loosen up and allow them to have fun or be spontaneous.</snippet>

         <snippet>Not for the faint of heart, the movie is unsettling and startlingly true to life. At least thatâ€™s how it seemed to me. To the minors I happened to be accompanying, it seemed to be reasonably good fun.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unaccompanied Minors, a sort of junior league version of "The Breakfast Club," never achieves the universal appeal of John Hughes's 1985 film about youth and authority.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unaccompanied Minors isn't likely to become a frequent flyer but it could strike a chord among children of divorce for many holiday seasons to come.</snippet>

         <snippet>Great performances from the young cast just can't make up for the overly familiar plot and pre-teen excesses of the action.</snippet>

         <snippet>Why bother suffering through 90 minutes of bad company for a few moments of holiday cheer? Especially when you can still stay home alone and watch "A Charlie Brown Christmas" somewhere on TV.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the writers had the guts (and the jokes) to fashion a bittersweet comedy with a fully earned happy ending, Unaccompanied Minors probably wouldn't have been made. As is, it's a prefab slapstick-'n'-pathos stew that doesn't taste like anything.</snippet>

         <snippet>A half-baked script by Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark admittedly gives Feig little to work with. But his young cast is capable of a lot more than is required of them in this so-called comedy.</snippet>

         <snippet>89 minutes go by like 89 hours. Not just 89 regular hours either: 89 hours of being stuck in an airport. During a blizzard. While Lewis Black sleeps drooling on your shoulder.</snippet>
