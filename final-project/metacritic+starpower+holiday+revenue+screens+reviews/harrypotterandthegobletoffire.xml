         <snippet>There's ample reason to stay with this series. When Harry says "I love magic," you believe it.</snippet>

         <snippet>Harry IV is an intelligent, visually seductive and mostly very satisfying fantasy epic of the first order.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's not until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire that a film has successfully re-created the sense of stirring magical adventure and engaged, edge-of-your-seat excitement that has made the books such an international phenomenon.</snippet>

         <snippet>The studio, like plucky Harry, passes with flying colors. The new one, directed by Mike Newell from another astute script by Mr. Kloves, is even richer and fuller, as well as dramatically darker. It's downright scary how good this movie is.</snippet>

         <snippet>Its look has the same grudging beauty that, once you get used to it, English weather does: It's so defiant in its grayness that you come to appreciate its conviction.</snippet>

         <snippet>Last year's "The Prisoner of Azkaban" seemed dark, but this excellent fourth film derived from J.K. Rowling's books is the darkest "Potter" yet, intense enough to warrant a PG-13 rating.</snippet>

         <snippet>J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter just keeps growing up. So do the Potter movies, in size, in ambition and in visual splendor - and with increasingly stunning results.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film is more violent, less cute than the others, but the action is not the mindless destruction of a video game; it has purpose, shape and style.</snippet>

         <snippet>By a pleasing irony, the parts of the film that stay with you are concerned not with the dark arts but with something far more unstoppable: teen-agers.</snippet>

         <snippet>The film's quick pace and near-constant action carries you along quite nicely, and by the time Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) makes his climactic appearance, one can't help but look forward to the remaining films.</snippet>

         <snippet>His (Ralph Fiennes) Voldemort may be the greatest screen performance ever delivered without the benefit of a nose; certainly it's a performance of sublime villainy.</snippet>

         <snippet>In the grand scheme of things, Goblet of Fire is perhaps closest to the original "Sorcerer's Stone."</snippet>

         <snippet>The uncontestable triumph of Goblet of Fire, however, is Brendan Gleeson's Alastor (Mad-Eye) Moody, the grizzled new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.</snippet>

         <snippet>Whenever it hits its stride, it's a well-acted, vividly executed, full-speed-ahead special-effects extravaganza that puts as much bang as possible into every remaining scene.</snippet>

         <snippet>Qualitatively different from its cinematic forbears: It doesn't linger on the gothic curlicues of its source material, it moves straightforwardly from place to place, and it emphasizes the emotional development of its characters with dramatic interplay rather than expressionistic, atmospheric gloom.</snippet>

         <snippet>The best thing about the picture is Harry's new maturity: For the first time, he dominates a picture named for him.</snippet>

         <snippet>Goblet of Fire, fourth in the fantasy franchise, is the most fun and the most fraught with conflict.</snippet>

         <snippet>Fine for people of developing minds, but the story so often stops its forward motion to take us on long detours into the land of CGI effects that it amounts to a $150 million magic show.</snippet>

      <review>
         <snippet>Inventive visuals and funny bits abound, but the film's gritty look and unsentimental characterizations - Harry, Hermione and Ron are far from golden teens - ominously foreshadow the truly wicked shape of things to come.</snippet>

         <snippet>A 157-minute holding pattern in which neither of the ongoing stories--Harry's conflict with the evil sorcerer Voldemort, the young schoolmates' coming of age at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft--progresses much.</snippet>

         <snippet>Kids may be appropriately terrified, but to this overgrown Potter fan, Voldemort, the Darth Vader of the black arts, was a heck of a lot scarier when you couldn't see him.</snippet>
