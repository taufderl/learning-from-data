         <snippet>Let's be honest, killing is this film's business...and business is good.</snippet>

         <snippet>Ninja isn't a great movie, but if you're in the right frame of mind, it is a bloody good time.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite the pace, though -- pedal, have you met my friend metal? -- Ninja Assassin still has some of its best stuff left at the end, when the master returns to demonstrate his extra-special, super-most-deadliest technique.</snippet>

         <snippet>The finest effect in this visceral gouge of a picture is Korean pop star Rain.</snippet>

         <snippet>This saga, set in Berlin, is more committed to its bloodletting than to any of its characters.</snippet>

         <snippet>A convincing, reasonably co-ordinated action movie. Nothing special, but lovers of the genre will enjoy the workouts, especially if they bring night-vision glasses.</snippet>

         <snippet>How is an action movie that aims for kinetic thrills supposed to develop any forward momentum when it spends so much time looking back?</snippet>

         <snippet>Seemingly made to capitalize on a dubious CG innovation -- namely, the slicing of bodies in half by whizzing five-pointed stars -- Ninja Assassin has little else to recommend it, not even laughs.</snippet>

         <snippet>Just not feeling the holiday spirit? Maybe a brainless, extra-bloody B-movie will provide the boost you're looking for.</snippet>

         <snippet>Director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) films most fights in impenetrable shadow, punctuated by death screams, blood splatters and CGI throwing stars glinting from some unseen light source.</snippet>

         <snippet>Decent ingredients but, as a whole, this is lacking in choreographic flair and plot substance.</snippet>

         <snippet>It’s like Bob Fosse night at the martial-arts studio. Most of the killing here is done with bladed throwing stars that, like the ninjas themselves, arrive from nowhere. They appear to have been used to edit the film as well.</snippet>

         <snippet>This amateurish action flick is so lacking in personality or punch, it ought to be titled "V for Video Store Discount Bin."</snippet>

         <snippet>Ten minutes after you leave the movie, all the battles will have blended in your memory into a ceaseless muddle of sliced-off appendages, jets of blood splashing artfully on walls, gurgling screams and flashing swords.</snippet>

         <snippet>A triple-cross plot with Harris's superiors doesn't help the movie's clarity--neither does the clattering sound design. Shouldn't throwing stars be silent? If they're gonna sound like gunshots, why not just use guns?</snippet>

         <snippet>You don't go into a movie called Ninja Assassin expecting a hell of a lot, but this shockingly disjointed and relentlessly dull picture can't even deliver the martial-arts kick its title so plainly promises.</snippet>
