         <snippet>But Anker's real success here is himself. He was obviously able to get these men and women to open up to him. And thus, quite obliquely, they remind us of a threat. As everyone knows, American symphony orchestras are in trouble. Attendance is dropping, and managements are trying various maneuvers, even stunts, to attract people.</snippet>

         <snippet>Daniel Anker's profound and moving documentary Music from the Inside Out reflects upon such abstractions, capturing the power of the creative process in an uncommonly perceptive and inspiring way.</snippet>

         <snippet>With a soundtrack that ranges from classical to jazz to bluegrass, this is not only an obvious choice for Â­music lovers, but required viewing for anyone interested in the mysteries of creative inspiration.</snippet>

         <snippet>Words sometimes fail, but energy and enthusiasm triumph in Music From the Inside Out, a docu that quizzes members of the Philadelphia Orchestra about their relationship to music.</snippet>

         <snippet>A revealing portrait of painfully withdrawn artists navigating the tug between the divine harmony of an orchestral synthesis and the sweaty glow of individual experimentation.</snippet>

         <snippet>Is it a great film? Not quite. It flits from idea to idea too promiscuously and relies too much on the visually deadening use of people talking on camera. But among the dull passages there are moving stories, and a very loving sympathy for the people it profiles.</snippet>

         <snippet>Anker evocatively captures the joys (and sometime frustrations) experienced by high-level artists working within an institution. The ardor they bring to their music is both enviable and inspiring.</snippet>

         <snippet>Daniel Anker's Music From the Inside Out is so intent on divining the mysteries behind the creative act that it comes up frustratingly short on specifics.</snippet>

         <snippet>The result is 90 minutes in the company of some of the nicest and most boring people you can imagine ever having a movie made about them.</snippet>

         <snippet>Presents itself as a musical essay, but would certainly fall more under the category of a love letter. And ultimately, what would you rather experience anyway?</snippet>
