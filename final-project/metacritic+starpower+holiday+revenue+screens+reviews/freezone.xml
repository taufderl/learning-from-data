         <snippet>Gitai's experimental technique in Free Zone is dizzying, sometimes thrilling.</snippet>

         <snippet>For all its intelligence, Free Zone has disappointingly little to say.</snippet>

         <snippet>A minor movie on a major subject, a drama with an almost unbearable lightness.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, the characters feel more like symbols than people, despite strong performances, including what might be Portman's finest work to date.</snippet>

         <snippet>Amos Gitai's most satisfying pic since war drama "Kippur." Schematic set-up is given a human face by fine performances and a physical journey that's often more interesting than the characters' emotional ones, which are weakened by the Israeli auteur's tendency toward convenient doctrinaire-ism and chunks of expository dialogue.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like a lot of Gita√Ø's films, Free Zone is part history, part allegory, and part art. Both the history and art hold their fascinations.</snippet>

         <snippet>Free Zone is similar to the car-based films of Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami but with a more improvised, less-finished feel.</snippet>

         <snippet>Unfortunately, the message is made clear within the first 10 minutes, leaving us with about 80 minutes of thematic repetition.</snippet>

         <snippet>The movie works best as a car's-eye travelogue of Jordan. And the three women might be good company on another, less stressful trip.   Say to the Caribbean.</snippet>

         <snippet>The three women deliver solid performances, but the film is diluted by the use of flashbacks superimposed over present-time scenes. The result is visual chaos.</snippet>

         <snippet>Oddly, in representing a private conflict as the microcosm of an unsolvable catastrophe, Free Zone only manages to miniaturize both.</snippet>

         <snippet>Despite a provocative climax, the movie settles into a ponderous collection of soliloquies.</snippet>

         <snippet>If the strong performances of its three stars infuse this metaphorically clotted movie with some life, the screenplay (some of which was improvised) has a weak narrative pulse. This political essay posing as a movie makes the mistake of confusing longwinded storytelling with compelling drama.</snippet>

         <snippet>A road picture mired by unsteady camera work, lackadaisical pacing and cumbersome speechmaking, Free Zone is an excruciating cinematic trek. Israeli director Amos Gitai's narrative, both visually and conversationally, is a disappointing dud.</snippet>
