         <snippet>Zippy enough to delight youngsters and clever enough to engage their parents.</snippet>

         <snippet>Even an advanced case of critter fatigue shouldn't stop you from rushing out to see this delightfully cheeky animated tale.</snippet>

         <snippet>The CGI is excellent, with characters whose depth and solidity suggest Nick Park's clay animations.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a sweet and mildly funny movie that will entertain young audiences, but one aspect is utterly mystifying: The two main characters, father and son bovine creatures, have large, distracting udders.</snippet>

         <snippet>All of Barnyard is odd. Oddly funny much of the way, oddly serious when it makes room for the early death of a beloved character or the hushed birth of another, oddly musical with its melange of hip-hop and reggae and hard rock and bluegrass.</snippet>

         <snippet>It feels like Barnyard swipes too much of its plot from "The Lion King."</snippet>

         <snippet>An often amusing but also an aimless and forgettable animated comedy that is noteworthy mostly for its random musical numbers and surprising amounts of violence.</snippet>

         <snippet>Like too many animated films aimed at children, Barnyard embraces stereotypes that generally no longer cut it in adult films, and for good reason.</snippet>

         <snippet>If you want to punish your kids, send them to bed without dinner. If you want to disturb, frighten and depress them while making sure they fail biology, take them to the animated feature Barnyard.</snippet>

         <snippet>Speaking as both a parent and a critic, I do believe I'd rather drive rusty railroad spikes through my eyes than have to sit through one more computer generated family film about talking animals. The bad news for Hollywood is that after seeing Barnyard my kids feel the same way.</snippet>

         <snippet>The disturbing thing in this preposterous piece of family fluff from writer-director Steve Oedekerk (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, the Oscar-nominated Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius) is the sight of bulls with udders.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's a fine message, but, in the case of the film itself, a little originality would have gone even further.</snippet>

         <snippet>It's always dispiriting to see children's movies succumb to desperate pandering to the coolness imperative, especially since, given the marketing muscle they tend to have behind them, the bigger trick seems to be in getting people not to see them.</snippet>

         <snippet>It shouldn't be surprising that writer-director Steve Oedekerk, the man responsible for "Kung Pow! Enter The Fist" and the second "Ace Ventura" movie, considers single-celled organisms as he shoots for the lowest common denominator.</snippet>
